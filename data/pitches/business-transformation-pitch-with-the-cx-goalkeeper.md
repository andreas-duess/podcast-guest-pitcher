# Pitch: Business Transformation Pitch with The CX Goalkeeper

## Subject Line Options
1. AI implementation in industries where change = heresy
2. Transformation lessons from food and agriculture
3. Beyond AI hype - practical insights from traditional sectors


## Pitch Email
Hi Gregorio,

Rick DeLisi's point about AI implementation being harder than adoption was dead-on. I've spent a decade proving that in food and agriculture - where "we've always done it this way" isn't resistance, it's religion.

Built and sold Canada's largest independent food marketing agency while helping commodity boards use AI to compete against global giants. Most transformation speakers come from tech. I come from an industry where suggesting change can end careers.

Yet we still used AI-powered research and data strategy to drive measurable results before our exit.

The parallels between contact center transformation and traditional industry AI adoption could give your audience fresh perspective on practical implementation.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: Business Transformation Pitch with The CX Goalkeeper

## Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **AI Implementation Reality Check** — Cutting through hype to show what actually works in practice
2. **Leadership Through Digital Transformation** — How leaders navigate technology adoption while managing people
3. **Customer Experience Optimization** — Balancing technology solutions with human-centered design
4. **Practical Business Results** — Moving beyond theory to measurable outcomes and ROI
5. **Technology-People Intersection** — How digital tools enhance (rather than replace) human capabilities

## Host's Interests and Style

**Gregorio Uglioni** is interview-driven with a practitioner's mindset. He clearly favors:
- Real-world experience over academic theory
- Guests who've actually implemented transformation (not just consulted on it)
- Practical, actionable insights listeners can apply immediately
- Stories that show both successes AND challenges/failures
- Global perspective (episodes feature international leaders)

**Style Note:** The "CX Goalkeeper" brand suggests he sees himself as defending against transformation failures — he wants guests who help leaders avoid costly mistakes.

## Audience Profile

**Primary:** Mid-to-senior level executives actively managing digital transformation initiatives
- **Pain Points:** AI hype confusion, transformation ROI pressure, balancing technology with customer experience
- **Expertise Level:** Sophisticated business leaders, not technical implementers
- **Geography:** International, with focus on enterprise-level organizations
- **Need:** Proven frameworks and real case studies they can adapt to their industries

## Overlap with Guest (Andreas Duess)

**Perfect Alignment Areas:**
1. **AI Practicality** — Andreas teaches AI strategy and actually uses it in traditional industries (vs. theoretical approaches)
2. **Business Transformation** — He literally transformed a traditional industry (food/agriculture) using data and technology
3. **Leadership Experience** — Built, scaled, and successfully exited a business while managing technological change
4. **Results Focus** — Has measurable outcomes: Canada's largest independent food agency, successful exit, ongoing ventures

**Unique Value:** Most transformation guests come from tech companies. Andreas brings transformation expertise from one of the most change-resistant industries on earth.

## Best Hook

**"How a Marketing Agency in the World's Most Traditional Industry Used AI to Beat Global Giants — And What Enterprise Leaders Can Learn"**

This hook works because:
- Food/agriculture transformation is harder than tech transformation (more relevant to most listeners)
- Concrete success story (built and sold the agency)
- Clear learning transfer to other traditional industries
- Addresses the AI-implementation challenge that's clearly a host focus

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"AI in the Contact Center: What's Real, What's Hype, What's Next? with Rick DeLisi"**

**Why This Episode:**
- Shows host's interest in separating AI reality from hype
- Demonstrates focus on practical AI implementation
- Contact center transformation parallels the customer-facing challenges Andreas solved in food marketing
- Recent episode (February 2026) indicates current priority topic

**Pitch Connection:** "Like Rick's contact center insights, Andreas brings real-world AI implementation experience — but from an even more traditional industry where the transformation stakes were higher and the resistance was greater."
