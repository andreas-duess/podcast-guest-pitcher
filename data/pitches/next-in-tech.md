# Pitch: Next in Tech

## Subject Line Options
1. Solving AI's adoption stall
2. Traditional industries doing AI right
3. Beyond experimental AI


## Pitch Email
Hi Eric,

Your Agentic AI episode nailed the core problem: "widespread yet fragmented adoption" despite massive AI investment. You identified it perfectly, and I've actually solved it in agriculture.

30 years building agencies in food and ag, co-founded Ditto (AI synthetic research), now teach AI strategy at Ivey. Most AI talk focuses on tech companies, but the real challenge is helping traditional industries get past experimental AI to actual results.

Agricultural commodity boards are some of the most change-resistant organizations on earth. Yet they're now using AI to beat gut-instinct decision making. I have the framework and case studies.

Interested in the implementation bridge story?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: Next in Tech

## Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **AI Implementation Challenges** — The gap between AI hype and real-world deployment, especially around use case selection and organizational maturity
2. **Enterprise Technology Adoption** — How large organizations navigate digital transformation, with focus on practical outcomes over theoretical potential
3. **Data Management Evolution** — The intersection of AI capabilities and data infrastructure, including cost management and operational efficiency
4. **Industry-Specific Tech Applications** — Real-world case studies of technology deployment across different sectors (retail, enterprise, etc.)
5. **Market Intelligence & Research-Driven Insights** — Heavy reliance on S&P Global's proprietary research (451 Research Voice of the Enterprise) to ground discussions in data

## Host's Interests and Style

**Eric Hanselman** is research-driven and analytically focused. He clearly prefers:
- **Data-backed discussions** over speculation (references specific studies, dollar figures, research findings)
- **Implementation reality** over technology evangelism 
- **Structured, interview-driven format** with subject matter experts who can speak to specific research or experience
- **Practical outcomes** — What actually works vs. what sounds impressive
- **Industry-specific insights** rather than broad generalizations

## Audience Profile

**Primary audience:** Enterprise technology decision-makers, likely IT leaders, CTOs, and strategic planners at mid-to-large companies. They want:
- Research-backed insights to inform buying decisions
- Real implementation guidance, not theoretical frameworks
- Industry-specific intelligence to benchmark against peers
- Understanding of what's working vs. what's still experimental

**Expertise level:** Intermediate to advanced — they understand basic AI/tech concepts but need deeper strategic guidance.

## Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment areas:**
1. **AI implementation in traditional industries** — Andreas's agriculture/food experience maps perfectly to the show's focus on real-world AI deployment challenges
2. **Research-driven insights** — His synthetic research company (Ditto) and academic role provide the data-backed perspective Hanselman values
3. **Enterprise AI strategy** — Teaching MBA students AI strategy aligns with the audience of business decision-makers
4. **Practical vs. theoretical** — Andreas's "AI for the Rest of Us" angle matches the show's implementation-focused approach

## Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Implementation Gap"** — Position Andreas as the expert who can explain why AI adoption is "widespread, yet often unstructured and fragmented" (directly referencing the Agentic AI episode's findings) specifically in traditional industries. His unique angle: most AI discussions focus on tech companies, but the real challenge is helping traditional industries (food, agriculture, manufacturing) move from experimental AI to structured, outcome-driven implementation.

**Specific pitch angle:** "Andreas can provide the missing piece to your recent Agentic AI discussion — he's actually solved the 'unstructured and fragmented' AI adoption problem in one of the most traditional industries on earth, and has the data to prove what works."

## Episode to Reference

**"Agentic AI Use Cases"** — This episode directly addresses the core challenge Andreas solves. The episode highlights "widespread, yet often unstructured and fragmented adoption" and "stall in overall maturity despite significant growth in usage." Andreas can speak directly to how traditional industries overcome these exact challenges, providing the structured implementation roadmap that the research suggests is missing.

**Pitch connection:** "Your recent episode on Agentic AI Use Cases identified the key challenge — fragmented AI adoption despite widespread usage. Andreas has the case studies and framework for how traditional industries can move past this stall point."
