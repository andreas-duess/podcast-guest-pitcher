# Pitch: The Intentional Agribusiness Leader Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Intentional leadership kills resentment
2. Why ag leaders burn out (and how to prevent it)
3. From tech CEO to agribusiness consultant

## Pitch Email
Hi Mark,

I heard your conversation with Landon about how innovation actually works inside agribusiness. Reminded me of my own journey convincing Canadian commodity boards that data could beat gut instinct.

I spent 30 years building tech solutions for traditional industries, including Canada's largest independent food agency which I built and sold. Now I help ag organizations figure out the gap between what their customers say they want and what data shows they actually buy.

What caught my attention about your show is how you focus on practical leadership that actually works in agriculture. I've spent the last decade helping traditional ag companies use AI to eliminate guesswork in everything from market positioning to team decisions. The "say-do gap" reveals itself differently in agriculture than other industries.

Your audience would probably connect with how leaders can use these tools to make better decisions faster.

Let me know if you want to chat about a potential episode.

Andreas

## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **Intentional Leadership as Anti-Resentment** — Core thesis that resentment comes from lack of intention; leaders must be deliberate in decisions
2. **The Power of Repetition & Consistency** — Appears in 2/3 recent episodes; consistent messaging and behaviors drive results
3. **Conversation Quality as Business Driver** — Focus on how better communication creates better outcomes
4. **Revenue/Growth Through People Systems** — Ed Howie's $350M impact, retention focus suggests audience cares about measurable business results
5. **Innovation Within Traditional Structures** — Landon at Nano Yield shows interest in how ag companies actually implement new ideas

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Mark Jewell is:**
- **Conversational, not interrogational** — Sits down "with" guests, not "interviews" them
- **Practical over theoretical** — Wants actionable leadership advice, not academic concepts  
- **Results-oriented** — Consistently mentions revenue impact, measurable outcomes
- **Anti-buzzword** — The "intentional" framing suggests he's tired of generic leadership speak
- **Agribusiness-native** — Understands the unique challenges of leading in traditional, relationship-heavy industries

## 3. Audience Profile

**Primary:** Mid-to-senior level agribusiness leaders (directors, VPs, owners) who are:
- Running teams of 10-100+ people in traditional ag companies
- Struggling with change management and modernization
- Looking for leadership frameworks that work in relationship-heavy, low-margin businesses
- Tired of generic business advice that doesn't apply to agriculture's unique constraints

**Secondary:** Rising leaders in agtech/agribusiness trying to bridge old and new approaches

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect Alignment:**
- **Traditional Industry Innovation** — Andreas has 30 years navigating tech adoption in conservative industries (food/ag)
- **Intentional Decision-Making** — His "data beats gut instinct" philosophy directly addresses Mark's core theme
- **Measurable Results** — Built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency (concrete outcome)
- **Agricultural Credibility** — Currently runs 6 Seeds (agricultural marketing), so he's not an outsider lecturing farmers

**Gap:** Andreas needs to frame AI adoption as intentional leadership, not just technology strategy

## 5. Best Hook

**"How Intentional Leaders Use Data to Replace Gut Instinct in Agriculture"**

This hook works because:
- Uses Mark's core language ("intentional leaders")
- Addresses agriculture's biggest leadership challenge (emotion vs. evidence-based decisions)
- Andreas has unique credibility — he's actually convinced commodity boards to change
- Connects to the "say-do gap" concept (what farmers say they want vs. what data shows they actually buy)
- Positions AI as a leadership tool, not a tech disruption

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"Landon Bunderson: The Power of Repetition in Leadership"**

**Why this episode:**
- Landon is Chief Science Officer at an agtech company — similar bridge between innovation and traditional ag
- "How innovation actually works inside a growing agribusiness" directly parallels Andreas's experience
- Shows Mark is interested in practitioners who've actually implemented change, not just consultants
- Creates natural conversation starter: "Like Landon at Nano Yield, I've spent years figuring out how to actually get agricultural organizations to adopt new approaches..."

**Pitch Opening:** 
*"I heard your conversation with Landon about how innovation actually works inside agribusiness, and it reminded me of my own journey convincing Canadian commodity boards that data could beat gut instinct. After 30 years at the intersection of technology and traditional industries — including building and selling Canada's largest independent food agency — I've learned that the most intentional leaders aren't afraid of AI, they use it to make better decisions faster."*
