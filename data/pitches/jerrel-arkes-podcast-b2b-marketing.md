# Pitch: Jerrel Arkes Podcast - B2B Marketing

## Subject Line Options
1. Leapfrogging the AI pilot paralysis
2. Traditional B2B's AI advantage
3. Beyond incremental: systematic AI adoption


## Pitch Email
Hi Jerrel,

Calvin Bleekman's knowledge retention point in your recent AI episode landed hard. I've been solving that exact problem with 100-year-old agricultural organizations that consider email a recent innovation.

I'm Andreas Duess. Spent 30 years building marketing agencies in food and agriculture, now use AI to help commodity boards compete against much bigger players. Unlike most AI speakers who come from tech, I implement this stuff with organizations that move glacially by design.

Here's what's counterintuitive: traditional B2B companies can leapfrog tech companies on AI adoption. While tech incrementally improves existing processes, traditional industries can make massive jumps by applying AI to problems that were never systematized in the first place.

Your audience is clearly past AI 101. I can share how conservative B2B companies skip the pilot project phase and move straight to sophisticated applications.

## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: Jerrel Arkes Podcast - B2B Marketing

## Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Practical AI Implementation** — Not theoretical discussion, but actual deployment strategies for B2B companies
2. **Knowledge Retention & Systems** — How companies preserve marketing intelligence when people leave
3. **Next-Phase Technology Adoption** — Moving beyond basic AI usage to more sophisticated applications
4. **B2B-Specific Solutions** — Tools and strategies tailored specifically for B2B marketing challenges
5. **Strategic Integration** — How AI integrates with existing marketing workflows and tools

## Host's Interests and Style

**Jerrel cares about:** Operational implementation over hype. He's interested in the "how" and "what's next" rather than introductory AI concepts. The focus is consistently on practical business outcomes.

**Interview style:** Structured but conversational. Asks specific questions about real-world applications. Prefers concrete examples over theoretical frameworks.

**Content preference:** Provocative takes backed by experience. He's clearly moved past "AI 101" content — his guests are practitioners discussing advanced implementation.

## Audience Profile

**Dutch/Flemish B2B marketing professionals** who are past the awareness stage of AI adoption. They're looking for sophisticated strategies and tools. Mid-to-senior level marketers dealing with:
- Marketing knowledge management
- Advanced AI tool selection
- Integration challenges
- Next-generation search optimization

**Expertise level:** Intermediate to advanced. They understand basic AI concepts and want implementation guidance.

## Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment areas:**
- **Traditional industry AI adoption** — Andreas brings exactly what this audience needs: proof that conservative industries can successfully implement AI
- **Knowledge preservation systems** — The Ditto synthetic research platform directly addresses the knowledge retention theme from episode #183
- **B2B practical implementation** — Andreas has 30 years of B2B experience, unlike typical AI evangelists
- **Next-phase AI usage** — His dual role (practitioner + educator) positions him perfectly for the "what's next" focus

## Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Implementation Gap"** — Andreas is the perfect counter-narrative to typical AI speakers. While most AI experts come from tech, Andreas successfully implemented AI in food/agriculture (industries even more traditional than most B2B companies). He has proof points from building and selling an agency, plus current AI tools in market.

**Specific angle:** How traditional B2B companies can leapfrog the "pilot project paralysis" that keeps them stuck while tech-native competitors pull ahead.

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**Episode #183 with Calvin Bleekman** — "De volgende fase in AI gebruik voor B2B bedrijven"

**Why this works:** Calvin discussed knowledge retention in B2B marketing. Andreas can build on this with Ditto (synthetic research platform) while adding the traditional industry perspective that Calvin's tech-focused platform lacks. Andreas represents the "next phase" for companies outside the tech sector.

**Pitch connection:** "Calvin talked about preserving marketing knowledge when people leave. Andreas has solved this same problem for commodity boards and agricultural companies — industries where institutional knowledge is even more critical and harder to systematize."
