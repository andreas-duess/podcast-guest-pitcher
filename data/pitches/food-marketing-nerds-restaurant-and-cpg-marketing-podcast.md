# Pitch: Food Marketing Nerds Restaurant and CPG Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Why consumer research lies to food brands
2. The say-do gap that's killing CPG campaigns
3. What wheat farmers taught me about purchase drivers


## Pitch Email
Hi Alex,

That Jägermeister episode about listening to customers sparked something for me. After 16 years building Canada's largest food agency, I discovered a brutal truth: what consumers say they want has almost zero correlation with what they actually buy.

I call it the "say-do gap." Focus groups tell food brands to go organic, then sales data shows conventional products still dominate. Surveys say health claims matter, then purchase behavior reveals price and convenience trump everything.

So I started using AI to study actual buying patterns instead of stated preferences. The results explain why so many food marketing campaigns fail despite perfect research.

Commodity boards used to burn millions targeting the wrong customers because traditional research pointed them in completely wrong directions. Now they can see what really drives purchases.

This might be more useful for your audience than another scaling story. Quick call to see if it fits?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis Brief: Food Marketing Nerds

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Consumer Research & Behavior** — Understanding what actually drives purchase decisions vs. what people say they want
2. **Scaling Operations** — The tactical challenges of growing from small/regional to national distribution
3. **Brand Strategy & Positioning** — How to differentiate in crowded categories and influence perception
4. **Research-Driven Decision Making** — Using data to validate strategy rather than relying on gut instinct
5. **Traditional vs. Modern Marketing** — Balancing established industry practices with new approaches

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Alex Oesterle is a tactical interviewer who values:**
- **Practical, implementable advice** over theoretical concepts
- **Real numbers and specifics** ("farmers markets to +5000 stores")
- **Uncomfortable truths** (explicitly mentions asking "hard and sometimes uncomfortable questions")
- **Research-backed strategies** rather than creative-only approaches
- **Scaling challenges** — consistently focuses on growth pain points

**Interview style:** Direct, results-focused, designed for working marketers who need actionable takeaways.

## 3. Audience Profile

**Primary:** Marketing professionals actively working in food/beverage companies
**Secondary:** Entrepreneurs planning food product launches
**Experience level:** Mid-level practitioners who need tactical guidance, not basic marketing education
**Pain points:** Scaling challenges, understanding consumer behavior, making data-driven decisions in traditional industries

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment areas:**
- Andreas built and scaled Canada's largest independent food agency (scaling expertise)
- His "say-do gap" concept directly addresses consumer research challenges
- AI-powered synthetic research solves the "listening to customers" problem better than traditional methods
- 30 years in traditional industries gives him credibility with skeptical food marketers
- Nourish exit story provides scaling case study with real numbers

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Say-Do Gap: How AI Finally Reveals What Food Consumers Actually Want (Not What They Say They Want)"**

This angle works because:
- Directly addresses the Jägermeister episode theme about "actually listening to customers"
- Connects to the Smashbrand episode about research-driven strategy
- Positions AI as a practical tool, not hype
- Andreas has 16 years of food industry data to back up his claims
- Offers tactical solution to universal food marketing problem

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"How Actually Listening to Customers Can Uncover Huge Opportunities, with Jägermeister's Chas Littlefield"**

**Why this episode:** The Jägermeister interview focuses on understanding consumer perception vs. reality for established brands — exactly Andreas's wheelhouse. The pitch should reference how traditional consumer research (focus groups, surveys) creates the say-do gap, while AI-powered synthetic research reveals actual behavior patterns that food brands can act on immediately.

**Pitch connection:** "Your Jägermeister episode touched on the challenge of influencing how consumers think about brands they think they already know. Andreas has spent 16 years discovering that what food consumers say they want and what they actually buy are completely different — and now he's using AI to close that gap for food brands who can't afford to guess wrong."
