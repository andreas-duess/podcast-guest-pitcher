# Pitch: 91 Day AI Transformation Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Convincing wheat boards to use AI (harder than it sounds)
2. From commodity boards to AI exit - transformation story
3. Traditional industry AI wins for your show


## Pitch Email
Hi Jonathan,

Your Shannon episode on building 7-figure AI businesses caught my attention. I did something similar but harder: convinced Canadian wheat boards to embrace AI, then built that into an exit.

Sold Canada's largest independent food marketing agency after 16 years, now teaching AI strategy at Ivey and running two companies. The difference? My clients were people who've farmed the same way for decades, not tech-friendly entrepreneurs.

Getting a commodity board to trust data over gut instinct taught me frameworks that work in any traditional industry. Your audience faces similar challenges - how do you implement AI when "we've always done it this way" is the default response?

I can share the exact playbook that turns Excel-dependent organizations into AI adopters, plus the revenue impact that follows.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Pitch Strategy Brief

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 key themes)

1. **Real Business Transformation Stories** — The host loves concrete examples of businesses that actually changed and grew using AI, with specific revenue/growth numbers
2. **Practical Implementation Over Theory** — Every episode emphasizes "no theory, just practical" with step-by-step guidance and actionable tips
3. **AI Adoption in Traditional/Non-Tech Industries** — Focus on how "regular" businesses (childcare, martial arts, etc.) can leverage AI without being tech experts
4. **Speed and Action Over Perfection** — Host repeatedly emphasizes "success loves speed" and "done is better than perfect"
5. **Demystifying AI Tools** — Breaking down specific tools (ChatGPT, MidJourney, etc.) for business owners who aren't technologists

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Jonathan Mast** is highly conversational and genuinely excited about AI success stories. He's:
- **Celebration-focused**: Loves giving public kudos and celebrating wins
- **Implementation-obsessed**: Constantly asks "how" rather than "what" 
- **Anti-hype**: Values real results over flashy promises
- **Tool-specific**: Gets into the weeds on actual AI tools and their practical applications
- **Mentorship-oriented**: Enjoys the back-and-forth learning dynamic with guests

## 3. Audience Profile

- **Small to mid-size business owners** in traditional industries
- **AI-curious but not AI-expert** — they want to use it but don't know how
- **Time-starved entrepreneurs** looking for efficiency gains
- **Skeptical but hopeful** about AI transformation claims
- **Action-oriented** — they'll implement if given clear, practical steps

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment on:**
- **Traditional industry AI adoption** (Andreas: agriculture/food; Podcast: childcare/martial arts)
- **Building and scaling businesses** (Andreas sold an agency; host talks business growth constantly)
- **Practical AI implementation** (Andreas teaches AI strategy; host wants actionable tips)
- **"Intelligence Economy" concept** (Andreas's thesis matches host's focus on data-driven decisions)
- **Teaching/education background** (Andreas teaches at Ivey; host clearly enjoys the educational aspect)

## 5. Best Hook

**"The AI Professor Who Actually Built and Sold a Business in Agriculture"**

This hooks into the host's love of real transformation stories while positioning Andreas as both credible (sold a business) and practical (teaches implementation). The agriculture angle is perfect because it's even more traditional than the industries they usually cover.

**Specific angle**: How Andreas convinced Canadian commodity boards (some of the most traditional organizations on earth) to embrace AI — and the specific tools and approaches that worked.

## 6. Episode to Reference

**"Building a 7 Figure Business with AI"** (December 26, 2025)

This episode is perfect because:
- It showcases someone who built something substantial (Andreas sold his agency)
- The guest (Shannon) came from traditional industries, just like Andreas
- It emphasizes the journey from skeptical to successful
- The host celebrates practical implementation over theory

**Pitch hook**: "I heard your episode with Shannon about building a 7-figure business with AI, and it reminded me of my own journey — except I went from Google to building and selling Canada's largest independent food marketing agency, and now I'm teaching commodity boards how to stop being afraid of AI and start using it to compete."

This creates immediate relevance while positioning Andreas as someone with even more traditional industry credibility than previous guests.
