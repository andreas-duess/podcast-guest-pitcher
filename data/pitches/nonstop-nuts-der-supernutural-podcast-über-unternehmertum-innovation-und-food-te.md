# Pitch: Nonstop Nuts - der supernutural Podcast über Unternehmertum, Innovation und Food Tech

## Subject Line Options
1. AI could accelerate your expansion
2. Food tech scaling the smart way
3. Skip the hard way on international growth


## Pitch Email
Hi Amelie and Timo,

Listened to your internationalization episode and kept thinking how AI could have accelerated those expansion decisions. You've proven product-market fit with Nutbooster, but scaling that intelligence is next.

16 years building Canada's largest food agency, working with companies terrified of data. Sold that business, now run AI research and teach at Ivey.

You're doing international expansion the hard way — same way I did before we figured out how to let data guide market selection and behavior analysis.

I can share tactical insights on AI-powered market intelligence for food tech scale-up. How to use synthetic research and behavioral data for smarter expansion bets.

Quick call make sense?

Andreas
