# Pitch: Fuelling Foodies: The Food Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Why paid ads can't fix broken research
2. The research problem killing food campaigns
3. What consumers actually buy vs. what they say


## Pitch Email
Hi Kate,

Your episode about paid ads not saving food brands got to the real problem: most food marketing fails because we're building campaigns on research that lies to us.

After selling my food agency, I dove deep into this. Traditional consumer research — focus groups, surveys, interviews — captures what people think they should say, not what they actually do when they're standing in the grocery aisle with their kids screaming and 20 minutes to get dinner sorted.

The gap between stated preferences and purchase behavior is massive in food. People say they want organic, buy conventional. Claim health matters most, grab whatever's on sale.

I use AI now to analyze actual buying patterns instead of stated intentions. The insights flip most conventional wisdom upside down.

Commodity boards have saved millions by targeting who actually buys their products instead of who says they will.

Want to explore this angle? Could be a useful episode for food marketers tired of campaigns that test well but don't move product.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (Top 5)
- **Real founder struggles vs. marketing fluff** — Kate explicitly positions against "generic advice" and focuses on "raw truth"
- **Category innovation & market entry** — Multiple episodes cover entering new categories (Crunch Corn) and emerging markets (non-alc wine)
- **What's actually driving growth beyond traditional tactics** — 2026 trends episode specifically calls out that "paid ads can't save you"
- **Scaling challenges for food & drink brands** — Consistent focus on growth obstacles and breakthrough moments
- **Timing and market positioning** — Episodes dissect when to launch, how to spot opportunities, and category dynamics

## 2. Host's Interests & Style
**Kate Williams is a no-BS practitioner who:**
- Values real experience over theory (calls out "founders who've done the 'right' things and still aren't seeing results")
- Likes contrarian takes that challenge conventional wisdom ("Why Paid Ads Can't Save You")
- Focuses on actionable insights from people who've actually built and scaled food businesses
- Prefers "founder-level conversations" over surface-level marketing tips
- Is skeptical of hype and predictions ("January is loud. Predictions. Hot takes.")

## 3. Audience Profile
**Food & drink founders and marketers who are:**
- Beyond startup phase but still scaling
- Frustrated with generic marketing advice that isn't working
- Looking for practical strategies from people who've actually done it
- Operating in traditional food categories but need to innovate
- Dealing with real growth pressure and resource constraints

## 4. Overlap with Guest
**Direct alignment:**
- **Built and scaled a food business** — Andreas co-founded and grew Nourish to Canada's largest independent food agency
- **Challenges conventional wisdom** — His "say-do gap" concept directly contradicts traditional market research
- **Traditional industry innovation** — His AI work in agriculture/food mirrors the podcast's focus on innovation in traditional categories
- **Actual practitioner credentials** — 30 years of real experience, not just theory
- **Successful exit story** — He actually sold his business, which Kate's audience wants to hear

## 5. Best Hook
**"The agency founder who discovered why every piece of consumer research in food marketing is wrong — and built AI tools to fix it."**

This hooks Kate because:
- It's a contrarian take that challenges industry norms (her style)
- It comes from someone who actually built and sold a food marketing business
- It addresses a core problem her audience faces daily
- It's not generic AI hype — it's specific to food marketing

## 6. Episode to Reference
**"2026 Marketing Trends: Why Paid Ads Can't Save You & What's Actually Driving Growth Now"**

**Why this episode:**
- Shows Kate is interested in challenging conventional marketing wisdom
- Demonstrates her focus on what's "actually driving growth" vs. traditional tactics
- The timing aligns with Andreas's message about data-driven decision making vs. gut instinct
- Sets up his "say-do gap" concept as the deeper reason why traditional marketing approaches aren't working

**Pitch connection:** "Your recent episode on why paid ads can't save food brands really resonated with me. After 16 years building a food marketing agency, I discovered the real problem isn't the tactics — it's that we're basing every decision on consumer research that's fundamentally wrong."
