# Pitch: The AI in Business Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Enterprise AI skepticism solved
2. Beyond pilots to scaled AI
3. Traditional sectors → AI believers


## Pitch Email
Daniel,

Nishtha's episode on enterprise AI skepticism — I've been living that challenge in one of the most traditional sectors imaginable.

Convincing commodity boards to trust data over decades of gut instinct was the breakthrough at my food marketing agency. Used the "say-do gap" to show how AI reveals what consumers actually do versus what they claim.

After the exit, I run AI synthetic research and teach at Ivey. Fortune 2000 companies make the same mistakes I made early on.

I have frameworks for getting traditional industries past pilot stage to scaled implementation. The playbook for turning agricultural skeptics into AI believers while building a sellable business.

Relevant for your audience?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (3-5 Key Themes)

1. **Scaling AI Beyond Pilots** — The gap between proof-of-concept demos and actual enterprise deployment at scale
2. **AI Governance & Risk Management** — Practical frameworks for managing AI risks in regulated, traditional industries
3. **Human-Centered AI Implementation** — Aligning AI capabilities with real-world operational workflows and human decision-making
4. **Enterprise ROI Reality Check** — Moving past AI hype to measurable business outcomes and defensible competitive advantages
5. **Traditional Industry AI Transformation** — How established sectors (banking, pharma, etc.) navigate AI adoption despite regulatory constraints

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Daniel Faggella** is research-driven and focuses on **practical enterprise AI strategy**. He's:
- **Interview-driven** with deep-dive conversations, not surface-level chat
- **Skeptical of AI hype** — wants real implementation stories, not theoretical possibilities
- **Focused on Fortune 2000 decision-makers** — seeks actionable insights for executives, not technical tutorials
- **Interested in systemic thinking** — how AI changes entire business models and competitive landscapes
- **Values contrarian perspectives** — willing to challenge conventional wisdom about AI adoption

## 3. Audience Profile

**Non-technical Fortune 2000 executives** who are:
- Responsible for AI strategy and ROI delivery
- Working in traditional, often regulated industries
- Past the "what is AI?" stage but struggling with practical implementation
- Need frameworks for scaling AI beyond pilot programs
- Concerned about governance, risk, and competitive positioning
- Looking for peer insights from other enterprise leaders who've actually done it

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment areas:**
- **Traditional industry AI adoption** — Andreas has done this in food/agriculture (some of the most traditional sectors)
- **Scaling beyond pilots** — He's actually implemented AI at enterprise scale, not just consulted on it
- **Data-driven decision making** — His "say-do gap" concept directly addresses the ROI measurement challenge
- **Building defensible competitive advantages** — He built and sold a successful agency using these principles
- **Teaching executives** — His Ivey Business School role shows he can translate complex concepts for business leaders

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Paradox"** — Andreas represents the perfect case study for this audience: someone who successfully implemented AI in the most change-resistant industries (food commodity boards) while building a scalable, sellable business. His "say-do gap" concept directly addresses the podcast's core theme of moving from AI demos to defensible enterprise value.

**Specific angle:** "How a marketing agency founder convinced Canadian commodity boards to trust AI over gut instinct — and built Canada's largest independent food agency in the process."

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"Enterprise AI Adoption at a Moment of Maximum Skepticism - with Nishtha Jain"**

**Why this episode:** The title perfectly captures Andreas's value proposition. While Nishtha discussed AI skepticism in biopharma, Andreas has actually overcome that skepticism in an even more traditional sector (agriculture/food) and has the business exit to prove it worked. This creates a natural conversation progression from "here's why enterprises are skeptical" to "here's someone who actually overcame that skepticism and won."

**Pitch connection:** "Your recent episode with Nishtha highlighted the skepticism challenge in biopharma. Andreas faced the same skepticism in agriculture — and figured out how to turn commodity boards into AI believers while scaling a business to successful exit."
