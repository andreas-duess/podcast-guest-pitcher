# Pitch: AI Business Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Getting wheat boards to trust AI over instinct
2. Traditional industry AI deployment reality
3. Non-tech AI adoption insights for your show


## Pitch Email
Hi Daniel,

That Schneider Electric episode nailed the core problem: AI's technical capabilities versus how traditional industries actually use it.

I translate AI for change-resistant sectors. Sold Canada's largest independent food agency after 16 years. Now I run AI-powered research company Ditto and teach at Ivey Business School.

Unlike most AI speakers who are technologists talking to technologists, I convince Canadian wheat boards that AI beats decades of gut instinct. With measurable results.

Your audience would connect with practical AI deployment in non-tech companies. The intelligence economy shift happening in traditional industries without the hype.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Enterprise AI Implementation** — How large organizations actually deploy and scale AI systems (IBM Watson X, Schneider Electric examples)
2. **AI Beyond the Hype** — Practical applications vs. buzzwords, demystifying technical concepts for business leaders
3. **Traditional Industries Meeting AI** — Energy, manufacturing, enterprise sectors adopting AI (not just tech companies)
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making** — Converting data into actionable business intelligence and measurable outcomes
5. **AI System Architecture** — Technical deep-dives on different AI approaches (generative vs. agentic AI, chain of thought reasoning)

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Interview-driven technical journalist** who:
- Loves demystifying complex AI concepts for business audiences
- Values real-world implementation stories over theoretical discussions  
- Asks pointed questions about practical applications and ROI
- Expects guests to explain technical concepts clearly without dumbing them down
- Shows particular interest in how traditional industries adopt AI
- Appreciates guests who can bridge the gap between technical possibility and business reality

## 3. Audience Profile

**Senior business leaders and technical decision-makers** who:
- Work at established enterprises (not AI startups)
- Need to understand AI's practical business impact
- Are responsible for AI strategy and implementation decisions
- Come from traditional industries (energy, manufacturing, agriculture)
- Want to cut through AI hype to find actionable insights
- Have technical literacy but aren't AI specialists themselves

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Andreas hits 4 of 5 core themes perfectly:**
- ✅ **Enterprise AI Implementation** — Teaching AI strategy at Ivey Business School
- ✅ **AI Beyond the Hype** — "AI for the Rest of Us" positioning
- ✅ **Traditional Industries Meeting AI** — Food and agriculture AI applications
- ✅ **Data-Driven Decision Making** — The "say-do gap" and synthetic research via Ditto
- ⚠️ **AI System Architecture** — Weakest area, but can discuss practical AI tools for traditional industries

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Translation Problem"**

Position Andreas as the rare expert who actually speaks both languages — he's built and sold a business in one of the most traditional sectors (food/agriculture) AND now develops AI tools for that space. Unlike most AI experts who are technologists talking to other technologists, Andreas translates AI capabilities into language that commodity boards and traditional industries actually understand and adopt.

**Specific angle:** "How do you convince a Canadian wheat board that AI beats gut instinct? Andreas Duess did exactly that — and has the scars and the success story to prove it."

## 6. Reference Episode

**"Schneider Electric CAIO on AI and Sustainability" (2024-03-13)**

**Why this episode:**
- Features a traditional industry (energy) implementing AI for practical business outcomes
- Discusses data science applications for real-world decision making
- Shows interest in how established companies adapt AI to their existing processes
- Guest explains technical concepts to business audiences
- Demonstrates the host's interest in sector-specific AI applications

**Pitch connection:** "Like your Schneider Electric episode showed how energy companies are using AI for sustainability decisions, Andreas brings that same practical approach to food and agriculture — but with the added credibility of having built, scaled, and successfully exited a business in that exact space."
