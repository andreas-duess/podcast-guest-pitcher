# Pitch: Digital Transformation & Leadership with Danny Levy

## Subject Line Options
1. Beyond the AI hype: what actually works
2. Transformation stories from agriculture
3. Making complex simple in conservative industries


## Pitch Email
Hi Danny,

Philip Davies nailed it in your recent episode about keeping AI simple. I spent 30 years doing exactly that in agriculture — one of the most change-resistant sectors you'll find.

Built and sold Canada's biggest independent food agency by convincing commodity boards that data beats tradition. The exit happened because we cracked the code on making complex technology feel inevitable instead of threatening.

Now I run an AI research company and see the same patterns everywhere: leaders want transformation but hate change. The organizations that succeed aren't the ones with the best technology — they're the ones that make adoption feel like common sense.

I can share the specific playbook that worked with wheat boards and dairy cooperatives, plus the expensive mistakes that taught me what doesn't work.

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Success Story"**

Andreas is the rare guest who can speak to Danny's audience about AI implementation without the typical tech industry bubble perspective. He's actually convinced commodity boards and food companies to adopt data-driven strategies, built Canada's largest independent food agency using these principles, and successfully exited. This mirrors Philip Davies' "simplicity in complexity" theme but with a concrete business-building and exit story that proves the approach works.

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"Harnessing AI: from Fear to Fortune and Why Simple is Smart w/ Philip Davies"**

- Andreas' "AI for the Rest of Us" approach directly parallels Philip's "simplicity as superpower" message
- Both guests help traditional industries cut through AI hype
