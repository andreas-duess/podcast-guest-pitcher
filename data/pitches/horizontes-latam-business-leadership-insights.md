# Pitch: Horizontes: LatAm Business Leadership Insights

## Subject Line Options
1. The real competitive gap in Latin America
2. Data-driven decisions vs. political connections
3. Traditional industries and the intelligence economy


## Pitch Email
Hi there,

Your episode on US-China competition in Latin America made me think about a parallel challenge: while leaders debate geopolitical trade dynamics, the real competitive advantage might be how quickly traditional industries embrace data-driven decisions.

I spent 16 years building Canada's largest independent food marketing agency with some of the most traditional agricultural organizations imaginable. The companies that thrived weren't the ones with the best political connections — they were the ones that turned data into decisions faster than their competitors.

Now I run an AI research company and teach strategy at Ivey Business School. Traditional Latin American industries face the same choice Canadian commodity boards faced: evolve how they make decisions or get outmaneuvered by data-native competitors.

The playbook for traditional industries is different from tech adoption. It requires understanding conservative organizational psychology while implementing sophisticated intelligence systems.

Could be a useful angle for your audience. Worth a quick call?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Strategy Brief

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Economic disruption and adaptation** — How major forces (COVID, geopolitical tensions, technology) reshape traditional business models
2. **US-Latin America power dynamics** — Trade relationships, foreign investment patterns, and influence competition
3. **Regional market transformation** — Industries evolving from traditional to modern approaches
4. **Strategic leadership during uncertainty** — How leaders navigate complex, shifting landscapes
5. **Competition for influence and investment** — Whether from China, US policy changes, or market forces

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Interview-driven and analytical** — The host focuses on extracting strategic insights from domain experts rather than casual conversation. They care about:
- **Geopolitical implications** of business decisions
- **Regional market intelligence** that affects multiple countries
- **Leadership perspectives** on navigating complexity
- **Practical frameworks** leaders can apply

**Style**: Professional, focused on actionable intelligence for decision-makers. Not looking for hot takes — they want substantive analysis from practitioners.

## 3. Audience Profile

**Senior Latin American business leaders and executives** who need to understand:
- Regional market dynamics affecting their industries
- How global forces (technology, geopolitics, economic shifts) impact local operations
- Strategic frameworks for navigating uncertainty
- Cross-border business implications

**Expertise level**: High — these are decision-makers, not beginners seeking basic education.

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment on three fronts**:
- **Traditional industry transformation** — Andreas's experience moving agricultural/food sectors from traditional to data-driven approaches mirrors the podcast's focus on market evolution
- **Cross-border business strategy** — His Google B2B background and international perspective fits the Latin American business leaders' need for global market intelligence  
- **Leadership through disruption** — Building, scaling, and exiting Nourish demonstrates exactly the strategic leadership the audience needs to hear about

## 5. Best Hook

**"How Traditional Industries Can Use AI to Compete Against Global Players"** 

This directly addresses the core challenge facing Latin American business leaders: staying competitive as global forces (technology, international competition) reshape their markets. Andreas offers a practitioner's roadmap — not theory, but proven frameworks from someone who actually transformed commodity-based businesses.

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"US responds to Chinese engagement in Latin America"**

This episode demonstrates the host's focus on how global competitive forces affect regional businesses. Andreas's angle would be: while everyone's worried about geopolitical competition, the real competitive advantage comes from how quickly traditional industries can adopt AI and data-driven decision making. Chinese companies are already doing this — Latin American leaders need practical frameworks to compete on intelligence, not just resources.

## Pitch Strategy

Lead with the China competition angle from their recent episode, then pivot to Andreas's unique value: he's the guy who actually took traditional, commodity-based businesses and made them data-driven winners. That's exactly what Latin American leaders need to hear right now.
