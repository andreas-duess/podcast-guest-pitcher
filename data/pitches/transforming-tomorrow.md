# Pitch: Transforming Tomorrow

## Subject Line Options
1. Closing sustainability's say-do gap with AI
2. Century-old farming orgs become genuine decision-makers
3. From good intentions to data-driven sustainability


## Pitch Email
Your Professor De Massis episode on family businesses and sustainability capability gaps resonates. I've spent the last decade solving that exact problem in agriculture.

I run agricultural marketing firm 6 Seeds and AI research company Ditto. Working with commodity boards and agricultural co-ops taught me that the "say-do gap" is sustainability's biggest enemy. The difference between what people say they'll do and what they actually do.

I've used AI to close that gap in agriculture, turning century-old farming organizations into genuinely sustainable decision-makers. Might interest your audience struggling to implement sustainability in traditional business contexts.

Call this week?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Sustainable transformation of traditional sectors** — Heritage buildings, family businesses, elderly care systems
2. **Balancing preservation with modernization** — Historic buildings maintaining character while becoming sustainable
3. **Long-term planning and capability building** — Planning for aging populations, building sustainable capabilities in family firms
4. **Practical implementation challenges** — Moving from willingness to actual capability in sustainability
5. **Global perspectives on local problems** — International experts addressing universal sustainability challenges

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Style**: Academic-practitioner focused, interview-driven format that digs into both theory and real-world application. Values nuanced thinking over soundbites.

**Core interests**: 
- How traditional/established entities adapt to sustainability requirements
- The gap between intention and execution in sustainability
- Capability building rather than just awareness raising
- Cross-sector learning and international perspectives

**Approach**: Thoughtful, research-backed discussions that acknowledge complexity rather than offering simple solutions.

## 3. Audience Profile

- **Primary**: Business leaders, sustainability professionals, academics
- **Secondary**: Policy makers, consultants in traditional industries
- **Expertise level**: Intermediate to advanced — comfortable with complex topics and academic research
- **Pain points**: Struggling to implement sustainability in established, traditional business contexts

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment areas**:
- **Traditional industry transformation**: Andreas's experience moving agricultural commodity boards (extremely traditional) toward data-driven decision making mirrors the podcast's focus on sustainable transformation of established sectors
- **Implementation gap**: His "say-do gap" expertise directly addresses the podcast's recurring theme of moving from willingness to capability
- **Agricultural sustainability**: Food and agriculture are core sustainability sectors the podcast would naturally cover
- **Technology adoption in traditional contexts**: His AI work parallels how the podcast explores modern solutions for traditional challenges

## 5. Best Hook

**"How AI is helping agriculture's most traditional players make genuinely sustainable decisions — and why the 'say-do gap' is sustainability's biggest enemy"**

This angle works because:
- Agriculture is a massive sustainability sector the podcast hasn't covered yet
- Andreas has actual experience implementing change in ultra-traditional organizations
- The say-do gap directly addresses their recurring theme of implementation challenges
- It offers a fresh technology angle grounded in sustainability outcomes, not just efficiency

## 6. Episode Reference Point

**"Keeping Sustainability in the Family"** — This episode focuses on family businesses struggling to move from willingness to capability in sustainability. Andreas's experience helping traditional agricultural organizations (many family-owned) adopt data-driven approaches to sustainability decisions provides a perfect parallel. The pitch should reference how Professor De Massis talked about capability gaps in family firms, and position Andreas as someone who's actually solved similar problems in agriculture.

**Pitch connection**: "Just as your recent episode with Professor De Massis explored why family businesses struggle to execute on sustainability despite good intentions, Andreas has spent years closing that exact gap in agriculture — one of the most traditional and family-dominated industries."
