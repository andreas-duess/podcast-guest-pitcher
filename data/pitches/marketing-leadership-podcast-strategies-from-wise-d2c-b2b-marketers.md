# Pitch: Marketing Leadership Podcast: Strategies From Wise D2C & B2B Marketers

## Subject Line Options
1. Weak differentiation kills demand gen
2. Agriculture meets AI strategy
3. 16 years agency building → AI teaching


## Pitch Email
Hi Dots,

Mark Evans nailed it when he talked about building marketing fundamentals before tactics. His point about weak differentiation limiting demand generation — I've lived that challenge in agriculture, where gut instinct ruled for decades.

Built Canada's largest independent food marketing agency over 16 years, sold it, then moved into agricultural marketing. The "say-do gap" Mark mentioned is everywhere in traditional B2B. What purchasing managers say versus what they actually buy are completely different things.

I've developed AI applications that cut research costs by 80% and work outside Silicon Valley. Now I teach this stuff at Ivey Business School.

Your audience deals with this differentiation problem daily. I can show them how to use AI to see what customers actually do, not just what they claim.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **Leadership & Career Evolution** — Host consistently explores how marketing leaders transition between roles, industries, and build expertise over time
2. **Strategic Foundation Over Tactics** — Strong emphasis on positioning, differentiation, and fundamentals before execution (Mark Evans episode exemplifies this)
3. **Audience-First Marketing** — Focus on understanding target segments, niche audiences, and authentic audience building (Jessica Rhodes, Eric Montgomery)
4. **Business Growth Through Marketing** — Interest in how marketing directly drives business outcomes, not just metrics
5. **Practical Implementation** — Host wants actionable insights that listeners can actually apply, not theoretical concepts

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Dots is a practitioner-focused interviewer who:**
- Values real-world experience over theory (guest list includes founders, not just consultants)
- Interested in career pivots and unconventional paths
- Cares about the "why behind the what" — strategic thinking that drives tactical decisions
- Conversational but structured — draws out specific insights rather than broad philosophizing
- Attracted to guests who've built something tangible (companies, processes, measurable results)

## 3. Audience Profile

**Mid-level to senior marketing professionals who:**
- Work in D2C or B2B companies (likely director to VP level)
- Want strategic insights they can implement immediately
- Are navigating career growth and skill development
- Need to justify marketing investments with business results
- Are curious about emerging technologies but need practical applications, not hype

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment in 4 areas:**
1. **Leadership Journey** — Andreas's path from Ogilvy → Google → Agency Founder mirrors the career evolution theme
2. **Strategic Foundation** — His "data beats gut instinct" philosophy aligns with Mark Evans's positioning-first approach
3. **Traditional Industry Innovation** — His work bringing modern marketing to agriculture/food fits the "practical implementation" theme
4. **Business Building** — 16-year agency build and exit provides concrete business growth case study

## 5. Best Hook

**"From Google to Grain: How I Used AI to Revolutionize Marketing in the World's Most Traditional Industry"**

This hook works because:
- References recognizable tech brand (Google) and traditional industry tension the host loves
- Positions AI as practical tool, not hype (audience-appropriate)
- Implies a career evolution story with concrete results
- Suggests actionable insights for traditional B2B companies

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**Mark Evans — Skills To Becoming a Business-Building Marketing Leader**

**Why this episode:**
- Mark talks about weak differentiation limiting demand generation — Andreas has the agricultural commodity board experience to show how this plays out in ultra-traditional industries
- Mark emphasizes fundamentals over tactics — Andreas's "intelligence economy" concept and data-driven approach directly extends this theme
- Both guests have fractional/advisory experience, suggesting the host values this perspective
- The "business-building" angle matches Andreas's agency exit story perfectly

**Pitch Connection:**
*"I loved your conversation with Mark Evans about building marketing fundamentals before tactics. I've seen this play out in the most traditional industry imaginable — agriculture — where I spent 16 years helping commodity boards replace gut instinct with data-driven decisions. Mark talked about weak differentiation limiting demand generation; I'd love to share how we solved this exact problem for Canadian farmers using AI tools that any B2B marketer could implement tomorrow."*
