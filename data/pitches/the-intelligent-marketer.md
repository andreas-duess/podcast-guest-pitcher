# Pitch: The Intelligent Marketer

## Subject Line Options
1. The say-do gap in agentic commerce
2. Unsexy industries building the best AI shopping
3. What's actually working in agentic commerce


## Pitch Email
Mike and Rishabh,

Sean Frank's agentic commerce episode nailed something I see daily: the gap between what consumers say they want from AI shopping and what they actually do.

30 years watching this "say-do gap" at Ogilvy, building Canada's largest independent food agency, now running an AI synthetic research company. While most discuss agentic commerce in theory, I help traditional industries actually implement it.

Sean said we're "on the freeway to the game," but I work with companies who think they're not invited. Some of the most compelling applications happen in unsexy industries. Commodity boards using AI agents to reshape how farmers buy inputs. Food companies finally understanding real purchase behavior.

I can share what's working (and failing) when traditional businesses build that "Me Store" Sean described.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: The Intelligent Marketer

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **Agentic Commerce Revolution** — How AI agents will fundamentally reshape how people shop and buy (featured prominently across episodes)
2. **Traditional Systems Meet AI** — How established industries/platforms (Visa's payment networks, traditional SEO) adapt to AI disruption
3. **Practical Implementation Over Hype** — Focus on what actually works today vs. theoretical AI marketing concepts
4. **Trust & Safety in AI Commerce** — The infrastructure challenges of making AI-driven commerce reliable at scale
5. **The Death of Traditional Funnels** — How AI is reshaping customer journeys from awareness to purchase

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Mike Duboe & Rishabh Jain** are practitioner-focused investors/operators who:
- **Care about:** Real-world implementation, not academic theory
- **Style:** Conversational but pointed — they push guests on practical details
- **Love provocative takes:** "We're not even in the parking lot" (Sean Frank), "AEO was invented by people looking to sell something" (Eli Schwartz)
- **Audience relationship:** They translate complex AI concepts for marketing practitioners
- **Sweet spot:** Guests who can bridge technical AI capabilities with actual business results

## 3. Audience Profile

- **Marketing practitioners** at mid-to-large companies implementing AI
- **E-commerce operators** trying to stay ahead of agentic commerce
- **Senior marketers** who need to separate AI signal from noise
- **Expertise level:** Intermediate — they understand marketing fundamentals but need AI translation
- **Pain point:** How to actually use AI in their business (not just talk about it)

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment on 4 fronts:**
1. **Traditional industries meeting AI** — Andreas literally teaches agriculture companies to use AI
2. **Practitioner credibility** — Built and sold a real business, not just consulted
3. **Say-do gap insights** — Maps directly to the hosts' focus on real consumer behavior vs. theory
4. **Anti-hype positioning** — His "AI for the Rest of Us" angle matches their practical approach

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Say-Do Gap in Agentic Commerce"** — Andreas can speak to the disconnect between what consumers say they want from AI shopping and what they actually do. His synthetic research company (Ditto) gives him real data on this gap, and his traditional industry experience proves he can translate AI hype into business reality.

**Specific angle:** "Most people talking about agentic commerce are building for what consumers say they want, not what they actually do. I've spent 30 years watching this gap, and now I have AI tools that finally let us see the truth."

## 6. Episode Reference Point

**"AI Will Create the 'Me Store,' with Ridge's Sean Frank"**

This is the perfect reference because:
- Sean talked about being "on the freeway to the game" — Andreas can speak to companies actually playing the game in traditional industries
- The "Me Store" concept needs someone who understands real consumer behavior gaps
- Andreas can build on Sean's agentic commerce vision with concrete examples from food/agriculture

**Pitch connection:** "Sean Frank talked about the agentic commerce revolution, but most traditional industries think they're not even invited to the game. I've been getting them off the freeway and onto the field."
