# Pitch: Iowa Agribusiness Radio Network Podcasts

## Subject Line Options
1. Market Intel for Iowa Ag Radio?
2. Trade insights from 6 Seeds CEO
3. Andreas here - futures pricing chat?

## Pitch Email
Hi Dustin,

I caught your conversation with Robert Cossar about Croplan's approach to seed genetics and producer relationships. I work the other side of that equation — helping agricultural companies like commodity boards and co-ops finally get scientific about their marketing decisions.

I spent 30 years building marketing agencies, including Canada's largest independent food agency. Now I'm running 6 Seeds, which serves ag clients, and teaching AI strategy at Ivey Business School. 

The interesting part: we can finally answer questions that agriculture has been guessing at for decades. Like "What actually drives farmer purchasing decisions?" instead of relying on assumptions.

I've got concrete examples of how Canadian commodity boards are using AI tools to optimize their marketing spend and improve producer ROI. Practical applications that Iowa agribusiness could implement tomorrow, not theoretical possibilities.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas
