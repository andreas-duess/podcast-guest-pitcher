# Pitch: Stacking Growth | The B2B Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. AI workflows without the hype
2. Making wheat boards comfortable with AI
3. Efficiency vs opportunity in AI


## Pitch Email
Hey there,

Your episode on integrating AI into workflows without hype — exactly what I teach at Ivey and implement with clients.

30 years moving traditional industries from gut-instinct to data-driven marketing. Built and sold Canada's largest food agency, now run AI research and help agricultural boards adopt synthetic research.

Your "AI efficiency vs AI opportunity" question — I've solved this in industries that make B2B SaaS look cutting-edge. Framework I use to get wheat boards and food manufacturers comfortable with AI, plus what moved the needle during our exit.

The say-do gap research might help your listeners dealing with unreliable survey data.

Worth 15 minutes?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: Stacking Growth | The B2B Marketing Podcast

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **AI as Practical Tool, Not Hype** — Every recent episode emphasizes real workflow integration over AI evangelism
2. **Performance-Driven Marketing** — Focus on systems, repeatability, and measurable outcomes over creative theory
3. **Modern B2B Demand Generation** — How traditional tactics need updating for saturated digital environments
4. **Tool Optimization & Efficiency** — Specific platform comparisons and workflow improvements
5. **Strategic Mindset Shifts** — How professionals need to evolve their thinking, not just their tools

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Refine Labs' approach is distinctly practical and anti-hype.** They care about:
- Tactical implementation over theoretical frameworks
- Real results in B2B environments
- Helping marketers navigate change without panic
- Systems thinking and repeatability
- Honest, transparent conversations about what actually works

**Style:** Interview-driven but tactical. They want guests who can bridge strategy and execution with specific examples.

## 3. Audience Profile

**Mid-level to senior B2B marketers** who are:
- Dealing with AI adoption pressure but want practical guidance
- Working at companies where they need to show ROI, not just innovation
- Looking for frameworks they can actually implement Monday morning
- Experienced enough to spot BS but still learning new approaches
- Caught between traditional marketing methods and emerging technologies

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment on three fronts:**
- **AI Practicality:** Andreas teaches "AI without the hype" — exactly what this audience craves
- **Traditional Industry Transformation:** His food/agriculture experience shows how to implement modern tactics in resistant environments
- **Performance Focus:** His agency exit proves he can build systems that actually work and scale

## 5. Best Hook

**"The marketer who convinced commodity boards to embrace AI-powered research"**

This hits their sweet spot: real AI implementation in the most traditional industry imaginable, with measurable business outcomes (agency sale). Andreas bridges the gap between "AI efficiency vs. AI opportunity" that they explicitly covered — he's done both.

## 6. Episode to Reference

**"Integrating AI into your workflow - without the hype!!"**

This episode directly mirrors Andreas's core message and expertise. The pitch should reference how Andreas has been doing this integration in agriculture and food marketing — industries that make B2B SaaS look cutting-edge by comparison.

## Pitch Angle

*"You covered AI workflow integration without hype — I've got the guy who taught Canadian wheat boards to use synthetic research. Andreas spent 30 years proving that traditional industries can adopt AI profitably, not just efficiently. He's got the agency exit to prove it worked."*
