# Pitch: Masters in Marketing Agency

## Subject Line Options
1. Agency evolution insights from 6 Seeds CEO
2. Community over competition in marketing
3. How we pivoted through industry changes

## Pitch Email
Hi Josh,

Your recent episode on keeping agencies afloat through industry changes hit me. I went through that exact challenge building Nourish Food Marketing over 16 years. We scaled from startup to Canada's largest independent food agency, then exited in 2019.

What nearly killed us wasn't competition or bad clients. It was the say-do gap. Food clients would fund campaigns based on focus groups and surveys, then wonder why sales didn't follow. Traditional research was killing traditional agencies.

Now I run an AI research company and teach strategy at Ivey Business School. I help agency owners bridge that gap using synthetic research and data tools that actually predict behavior instead of just measuring opinions.

The story of how we cracked this code might be valuable for your audience. How other agencies can use AI practically without the Silicon Valley hype.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas

## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis: Masters in Marketing Agency

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **Agency Evolution & Adaptation** — How established agencies pivot and survive industry changes (SEO updates, AI disruption, new platforms)
2. **Community Over Competition** — Building collaborative business models vs. traditional competitive approaches
3. **Multi-Channel Integration** — Combining traditional and digital tactics for maximum impact
4. **Transparency & Data-Driven Results** — Moving beyond gut instinct to measurable, scalable strategies
5. **Practical Expertise Over Hype** — Real-world implementation stories vs. theoretical frameworks

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

Josh Hoffman is **practitioner-focused and story-driven**. He wants guests who've "been in the trenches" and can share specific wins/losses. He favors:
- **War stories over theory** — Notice the maritime metaphors ("changing tides," "keeping agencies afloat")
- **Actionable strategies** — Every episode promises tactics listeners can implement
- **Industry camaraderie** — Values the "wisdom" and community aspect of agency ownership
- **Innovation within tradition** — How to blend cutting-edge tools with proven fundamentals

## 3. Audience Profile

**Mid-level agency owners and senior managers** who are:
- Running established agencies (not startups)
- Feeling pressure from industry changes (AI, platform shifts, economic uncertainty)
- Looking for peer-level advice from people who've scaled and survived
- Want tactical guidance they can implement immediately
- Hungry for community and shared experiences from fellow "veterans"

## 4. Overlap with Guest

Andreas maps perfectly to this audience because he:
- **Built and scaled** an agency from startup to market leader (16 years at Nourish)
- **Successfully exited** — the ultimate agency owner goal
- **Bridges traditional + digital** — exactly what this audience struggles with
- **Has AI expertise** without the hype — practical implementation in conservative industries
- **Teaches strategy** — can distill complex concepts into actionable frameworks

## 5. Best Hook

**"The agency owner who built Canada's largest independent food agency, sold it successfully, and now uses AI to solve the same client challenges that nearly killed his business 10 years ago."**

This hits three podcast themes simultaneously: agency evolution, practical over hype, and transparency through data. It positions Andreas as both a successful exit story AND someone solving current industry pain points.

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"Mastering SEO and Conversion Tactics"** — This episode focuses on "keeping agencies afloat amidst changing tides" and "actionable strategies." Andreas's story directly parallels this: he navigated industry disruption (digital transformation in food marketing), survived by adapting, and now helps other agencies do the same with AI tools.

**Pitch angle**: "Like Michael Fleischner helped agencies navigate SEO changes, Andreas helps traditional industry agencies navigate AI adoption — with the added credibility of having built and successfully sold an agency himself."
