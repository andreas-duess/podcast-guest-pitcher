# Pitch: Business Buying Masterclass Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. AI already does 80% of your due diligence work
2. M&A blind spots from a recent seller
3. Due diligence revolution most buyers are missing


## Pitch Email
Hi Keith,

Jeff Rossi's points about parsing massive data dumps during due diligence caught my attention. Most M&A professionals don't realize AI can already handle 80% of that work.

I recently sold Nourish Food Marketing after 16 years, so I understand the process your audience goes through. But now I run an AI research company and teach AI strategy at Ivey - AI is quietly revolutionizing due diligence in ways that could give your listeners real competitive advantage.

Specific AI tools are already changing how buyers evaluate traditional businesses. Plus some hard lessons from my own sale process that your audience would find valuable.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis Brief: Business Buying Masterclass

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Due Diligence Deep Dives** — The nitty-gritty of financial verification, quality of earnings, and uncovering hidden risks
2. **Post-LOI Process Management** — What happens after the handshake deal, managing timelines and expectations
3. **Deal Structure & Valuation** — How multiples work, add-backs, and what drives enterprise value
4. **Industry-Specific Challenges** — Different sectors require different approaches (healthcare, retail, manufacturing)
5. **Red Flags & Deal Killers** — COVID bumps, customer concentration, unsustainable revenue spikes

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Keith D is a practitioner-focused interviewer who:**
- Values real-world war stories over theory ("I'd love to hear maybe a couple stories...")
- Cares deeply about timeline pressure and execution ("60-90 days to get the deal done")
- Wants specific, actionable insights his audience can use immediately
- Appreciates guests who've been in the trenches and have scars to show for it
- Style: Conversational but structured, lets guests tell stories, asks follow-up questions

## 3. Audience Profile

**Mid-market M&A professionals and business owners:**
- Deal sizes: $5M+ revenue companies
- Mix of sell-side advisors, buyers, and business owners preparing to sell
- Experienced enough to want detailed process insights, not basic concepts
- Time-pressed professionals who need practical, immediately applicable advice
- Value case studies and real examples over theoretical frameworks

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment areas:**
- **Agency Sale Experience**: Andreas built and sold Nourish — exactly what this audience does
- **Industry Expertise**: Food/agriculture marketing = specialized due diligence knowledge
- **Valuation Challenges**: Traditional industries have unique valuation complexities
- **AI Due Diligence**: Emerging area most M&A professionals don't understand yet

## 5. Best Hook

**"How AI is About to Disrupt M&A Due Diligence (And Most Advisors Don't See It Coming)"**

This is the perfect intersection of Andreas's AI expertise with the podcast's due diligence obsession. Keith's audience knows due diligence is time-pressed and labor-intensive. Andreas can show how AI tools are already changing how smart buyers evaluate traditional businesses — and how sell-side advisors can use this to their advantage.

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"Session #11: Financial Due Diligence"**

This episode is perfect because:
- It's the most recent and detailed episode available
- Shows Keith's deep interest in the due diligence process
- Features industry specialization as a key theme (exactly Andreas's strength)
- Discusses time pressure and information parsing — where AI excels
- The guest (Jeff Rossi) talks about "data dumps" and parsing information quickly

**Pitch Connection**: "I listened to your episode with Jeff Rossi about financial due diligence, and when he talked about getting 'data dumps' and having to parse through massive amounts of information quickly, I realized most M&A professionals don't know that AI can already do 80% of that work..."

This positions Andreas as the logical next guest to advance the conversation Keith is already having with his audience.
