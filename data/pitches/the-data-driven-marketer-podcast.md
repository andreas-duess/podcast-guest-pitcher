# Pitch: The Data-Driven Marketer Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Measuring what matters vs what's easy
2. The say-do gap is an intelligence problem
3. When commodity boards outmaneuver consumer brands


## Pitch Email
You nailed the core problem in your measurement gaps episode: marketers measure what's easy, not what matters.

I spent 16 years building Canada's largest independent food agency by solving this challenge. While everyone asked consumers what they *said* they wanted, we used AI to see what they actually *did*. The difference was massive.

Now I run an AI research company and teach at Ivey Business School. The key insight: the say-do gap isn't a research problem, it's an intelligence problem. Companies that close this gap don't just get better measurement, they build sustainable advantages.

Commodity boards (some of the most traditional organizations around) are now outmaneuvering consumer brands by measuring behavior instead of opinions.

Happy to share the playbook. What does your calendar look like?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Attribution & Measurement Evolution** — Moving beyond last-touch attribution and ROAS-only mindsets to multi-layered measurement approaches
2. **Full-Funnel Strategy** — Balancing upper-funnel brand building with lower-funnel conversion optimization
3. **The Performance vs. Growth Tension** — Why hitting performance metrics doesn't always translate to sustainable business growth
4. **Real-Time Decision Making** — Using data to make tactical adjustments while maintaining strategic direction
5. **Organizational Change Management** — How marketing teams need to restructure to implement better measurement and growth strategies

## Host's Interests and Style

**What they care about:** Practical, implementable solutions to marketing measurement challenges. The host is obsessed with the gap between what marketers think is working and what actually drives business growth.

**Style:** Interview-driven but solution-focused. They want concrete frameworks, not theoretical discussions. The questions suggest they value guests who can bridge strategy and execution.

**Preference:** They favor provocative takes that challenge conventional wisdom (like "your ROAS goals are killing your growth") but only when backed by practical alternatives.

## Audience Profile

**Who:** Mid-to-senior level marketers at brands (not agencies) who are frustrated with current measurement approaches
**Expertise level:** Sophisticated enough to understand attribution models but struggling to implement better solutions
**Pain points:** Stuck between hitting short-term performance metrics and driving long-term growth; dealing with measurement gaps in an increasingly complex channel landscape

## Overlap with Guest

**Direct mapping:**
- Andreas's "Say-Do Gap" concept directly addresses the measurement accuracy issues this podcast obsesses over
- His AI/data expertise offers practical solutions to the attribution challenges discussed in every episode
- His traditional industry background (food/agriculture) provides unique perspective on implementing data-driven approaches in resistant organizations
- His agency-building experience gives him credibility on the organizational change aspect

## Best Hook

**"The Intelligence Economy Solves the Measurement Gap"**

Position Andreas as the guest who can explain how AI and synthetic research finally solve the attribution and measurement challenges the podcast repeatedly explores. His unique angle: traditional industries are actually better positioned to implement these solutions because they're not stuck in performance marketing orthodoxy.

Specific hook: "Most marketers are measuring the wrong things because they're asking consumers the wrong questions. Andreas built and sold Canada's largest food agency by using AI to bridge the say-do gap that's killing most brands' growth strategies."

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"How to Fix the Measurement Gap and Drive Real Growth with Code3"**

This episode directly sets up Andreas's expertise. Reference the "measurement gap" concept and position Andreas as having solved this exact problem in traditional industries using AI-powered research that reveals what consumers actually do vs. what they say. This creates a natural continuation of the conversation Code3 started.

**Pitch angle:** "Your Code3 episode nailed the measurement gap problem. Andreas has the solution — and he's proven it works in industries where gut instinct has ruled for decades."
