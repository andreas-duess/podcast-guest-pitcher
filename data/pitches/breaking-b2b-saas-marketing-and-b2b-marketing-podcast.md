# Pitch: Breaking B2B - SaaS Marketing and B2B Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Bootstrap tactics from traditional B2B to SaaS
2. Million-dollar agency sales lessons for B2B
3. The say-do gap in enterprise buying decisions


## Pitch Email
Hi Sam,

Samu's scrappy founder tactics in #473 reminded me of building Canada's largest independent food agency using similar bootstrap principles - just with million-dollar commodity board budgets instead of startup constraints.

Here's what your audience is missing: selling to traditional industries teaches you the "say-do gap" between what B2B buyers claim they want versus what they actually purchase. Those insights translate directly to SaaS sales.

Plus traditional industries adopt AI faster than most SaaS companies because they focus on practical applications, not hype.

I can break down how relationship-driven sales actually scales and what I learned building from zero to exit in agriculture - the most traditional sector on earth.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Themes)

1. **Scrappy, bootstrapped growth tactics** — Manual outreach, working for free initially, grinding through early stages
2. **Marketing channel experimentation** — What works vs. what fails, tactical channel breakdowns
3. **Niche specialization and ICP clarity** — Finding your ideal customer profile through trial and pain
4. **Personal brand + content as foundation** — LinkedIn/YouTube content supporting all other marketing efforts  
5. **Referrals and word-of-mouth as endgame** — Building systems that compound through excellent delivery

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Sam Dunning** is:
- **Anti-fluff, pro-tactical** — "No background stories, BS or fluff"
- **Obsessed with what actually works** — Recent episodes focus on "what works now" and live strategy builds
- **Growth-stage focused** — Interested in companies that have proven traction ($50k/month stories)
- **Channel-specific** — Deep dives into SEO, cold email, YouTube strategies
- **Conversational but structured** — Asks direct questions about failures, successes, and actionable takeaways

## 3. Audience Profile

- **B2B marketers and founders** at growth-stage companies
- **SaaS marketing leaders** looking for proven tactics
- **Bootstrapped entrepreneurs** who need scrappy, cost-effective strategies
- **Intermediate to advanced** — They want specifics, not basics
- **Practitioners, not theorists** — People who will actually implement what they hear

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment areas:**
- **Traditional industry + modern marketing** — Andreas brought data/AI to commodity boards (ultimate traditionalists)
- **Agency build and exit story** — 16 years, bootstrap to Canada's largest independent, successful exit
- **AI as practical tool** — Not hype, but actual business applications for non-tech companies
- **The "say-do gap"** — Consumer research vs. reality (massive B2B marketing problem)
- **Career pivot story** — Ogilvy London to Canadian agriculture (unconventional path to success)

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industries AI Playbook"** — How a guy who went from Ogilvy to selling to Canadian potato farmers built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency, and what B2B marketers can steal from industries that move slow but spend big.

This hits Sam's sweet spots:
- Proven business success (built and sold)
- Contrarian angle (traditional industries doing AI right)
- Tactical applications (specific strategies B2B can use)
- Anti-hype positioning (practical AI, not buzzwords)

## 6. Episode to Reference

**#473 "How This 19-Year-Old Built a $50k/Month B2B Business"**

**Why this works:**
- Shows Sam values **unconventional success stories** (19-year-old founder)
- Demonstrates interest in **bootstrap-to-scale narratives**
- Proves he wants **tactical channel breakdowns** (what worked/failed)
- Andreas offers the **mature version** of this story (30 years experience, actual exit)

**Pitch angle:** "Your episode with Samu showed how scrappy tactics work for young founders. I've got the other side — how someone with 30 years in traditional industries used similar bootstrap principles to build and sell Canada's largest independent food agency. Plus, how B2B marketers can steal tactics from industries where a single client might spend $2M/year."

## Recommended Pitch Focus

Position Andreas as the **"traditional industries whisperer"** who can teach B2B marketers how to sell to the most conservative, relationship-driven industries on earth — and how AI actually helps with this rather than hurts it.
