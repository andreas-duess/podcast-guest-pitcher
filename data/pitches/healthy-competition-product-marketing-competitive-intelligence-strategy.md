# Pitch: Healthy Competition: Product Marketing | Competitive Intelligence | Strategy

## Subject Line Options
1. How wheat boards outmaneuver tech startups
2. Competitive intelligence in traditional industries
3. When boring beats innovative


## Pitch Email
Hi Andy,

April Dunford's point about bashing approaches, not competitors, hit home. I've been helping agricultural commodity boards compete against venture-backed agtech startups using exactly that strategy.

Built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency over 16 years, now run an AI research company and teach competitive strategy at Ivey. Here's what's interesting: while B2B tech companies argue about features, traditional industries are getting sophisticated about competitive intelligence.

Wheat boards and dairy co-ops — organizations most people consider "boring" — are using superior market intelligence to outmaneuver companies with 10x their R&D budgets.

They're competing in what I call the "intelligence economy." Better data about customer behavior beats better technology almost every time.

Your audience would benefit from seeing how these traditional industries turned information advantages into market wins. The tactics translate directly to B2B tech.

15-minute call to dig into this?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## Recurring Themes
1. **Competitive positioning and differentiation** — Core focus on how B2B companies stand out in crowded markets
2. **Practical intelligence over theory** — Real-world application of competitive strategy, not academic concepts
3. **B2B tech market dynamics** — Understanding how technology companies compete and win
4. **Strategic positioning frameworks** — Systematic approaches to market positioning and competitive analysis
5. **Founder/practitioner insights** — Learning from people who've actually built and scaled businesses

## Host's Interests and Style
Andy is **practitioner-focused** and values **battle-tested expertise** over theoretical knowledge. Based on the April Dunford episode focus, he's interested in the intersection of competitive intelligence and positioning. He appears to prefer **actionable frameworks** and **specific methodologies** rather than high-level strategy talk. The show's tagline ("help you stand out and win") suggests he wants **competitive advantage tactics** that listeners can actually implement.

## Audience Profile
**B2B tech professionals** at director+ level who are responsible for competitive strategy, product marketing, or business development. They're sophisticated enough to appreciate nuanced positioning discussions (evidenced by April Dunford's appearance) but want **immediately applicable insights**. Likely includes founders, product marketers, competitive intelligence professionals, and senior marketing leaders at growth-stage B2B companies.

## Overlap with Guest
Andreas hits this podcast's sweet spot perfectly:
- **Practitioner credibility**: Built and sold a business (not just a consultant)
- **Competitive intelligence expertise**: His "say-do gap" concept directly addresses market intelligence
- **B2B positioning experience**: Helped traditional industries compete against tech-forward competitors
- **Differentiation story**: His unconventional path from agencies to agriculture to AI creates natural positioning lessons
- **Market intelligence focus**: Ditto's synthetic research directly serves competitive intelligence needs

## Best Hook
**"How Traditional Industries Beat Tech Companies at Their Own Game"** — Andreas has helped commodity boards and food companies compete against venture-backed tech startups by leveraging superior market intelligence. This flips the typical "tech disruption" narrative and gives B2B tech listeners a competitor's playbook. His "intelligence economy" thesis directly supports the show's competitive intelligence focus, while his agency exit proves he can execute, not just theorize.

## Episode to Reference
**"April Dunford: Nailing Competitive Positioning"** — Andreas's approach to positioning traditional companies against tech competitors directly builds on April's positioning framework. His experience with "bashing approaches, not competitors" when helping agricultural clients compete against agtech startups would resonate with listeners who engaged with April's episode. Plus, Andreas teaches positioning at business school level, creating natural credibility bridge.

## Pitch Angle
Position Andreas as the "competitive intelligence practitioner" who shows B2B tech companies how their traditional industry targets are getting sophisticated about competition — and what tech companies can learn from industries that have been competing on intelligence rather than venture capital.
