# Pitch: Peppered: A Food and Beverage Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Agency side of commodity board work
2. The say-do gap in food marketing
3. What consumers actually do vs say


## Pitch Email
Hi there,

Tara-Ann from National Pork Board was great. I've spent years on the other side of that relationship, helping commodity boards navigate the gap between consumer insights and actual shopping behavior.

Built and sold Nourish Food Marketing after 16 years working with everyone from startups to ag boards. The "say-do gap" drives me crazy — consumers tell us one thing in research, do something completely different at shelf.

Now using AI to help traditional food companies see past what people say to what they actually do. Changes everything from positioning to media planning.

Can share the agency perspective on commodity board work plus practical AI examples.

Worth a conversation?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis Brief: Peppered

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Consumer Behavior & Psychology** — Understanding what drives food choices beyond rational decision-making
2. **Brand Building in Traditional Categories** — How to create differentiation in established food sectors
3. **Industry Expertise & Practical Insights** — Deep-dive conversations with practitioners who've done the work
4. **Science Meets Marketing** — The intersection of food science, research, and consumer appeal
5. **Category-Specific Challenges** — Tactical discussions about specific food segments (cereal, pork, etc.)

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**What the host cares about:**
- Practitioners over theorists (every guest has hands-on experience)
- The psychology behind food marketing ("LOVE of FOOD is one of the strongest human emotions")
- Scientific backing for marketing decisions ("Science and Art" driving appetite appeal)
- Real-world case studies and specific examples

**Style:** Interview-driven with a focus on actionable insights. Values both the emotional/psychological aspects of food marketing AND the data/research foundation. Not looking for hot takes — wants practical wisdom from people who've built something.

## 3. Audience Profile

**Who listens:** Food and beverage marketers, brand managers, and entrepreneurs looking for practical guidance. Mid-level professionals who need to understand both the strategic and tactical sides of food marketing. Based on guest selection (National Pork Board, startup founders), audience spans from large organizations to emerging brands.

**Expertise level:** Intermediate practitioners — they know the basics but want deeper insights from experts who've navigated specific challenges.

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct mapping:**
- **Nourish Food Marketing experience** — 16 years building Canada's largest independent food agency
- **Commodity board work** — Agricultural marketing aligns perfectly with National Pork Board episode
- **Consumer research expertise** — "Say-do gap" concept directly addresses consumer behavior insights
- **AI in traditional industries** — Modern approach to age-old food marketing challenges
- **Agency perspective** — Understanding both client-side and agency-side food marketing

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Say-Do Gap in Food Marketing: Why Consumer Research Gets It Wrong (And How AI Finally Gets It Right)"**

This hook works because:
- Addresses the host's clear interest in consumer psychology and food emotions
- Challenges conventional research methods (provocative but practical)
- Positions Andreas as the bridge between traditional food marketing and modern tools
- Offers actionable insights for the audience's daily work
- References his unique combination of agency experience + AI expertise

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**#19 Pork Inspiration with Tara-Ann Dugan (National Pork Board)**

**Why this episode:** Andreas has direct experience working with agricultural commodity boards — exactly like the National Pork Board. He can speak to the same challenges Tara-Ann faces but from the agency/consultant perspective, plus offer insights on how AI is transforming commodity marketing. This creates a natural continuation of that conversation while adding a fresh angle the host hasn't covered.

**Pitch angle:** "Your conversation with Tara-Ann from the National Pork Board really resonated with me — I've spent years on the other side of that relationship, helping commodity boards navigate consumer insights and marketing challenges. I'd love to share what I've learned about the gap between what consumers tell us in research versus what they actually do when shopping for food."
