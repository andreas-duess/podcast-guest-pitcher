# Pitch: Ag Geek Speak

## Subject Line Options
1. Turning precision ag data into farmer action
2. AI + spatial data insights for Ag Geek
3. Beyond pretty maps - behavioral change in ag


## Pitch Email
Hi Jodi,

That NAIP imagery episode with Sarah was solid - loved how you broke down turning high-res data into field insights. But here's what I keep hearing from precision ag consultants: farmers love the maps but still don't implement the recommendations.

I'm Andreas Duess. Built and sold Canada's largest food marketing agency, now run 6 Seeds and teach AI at Ivey. I use AI to solve exactly this gap - turning agricultural data into communications that actually change farmer behavior.

Synthetic research can predict which data presentations drive on-farm adoption versus which ones just look impressive. Your audience deals with this daily: how do you move from analysis to action?

Quick call to dig into this?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis Brief: Ag Geek Speak

## Recurring Themes (Key Focus Areas)

1. **Practical precision agriculture tools and technologies** — Heavy focus on actionable mapping, imagery analysis, and data applications
2. **Data quality and geospatial accuracy** — Obsession with resolution, georeferencing, and reliable data sources
3. **Making complex ag tech accessible** — Breaking down technical concepts for practical field application  
4. **Real-world problem solving** — Emphasis on "how-to" rather than theoretical discussions
5. **Technology adoption in traditional agriculture** — Bridging the gap between available tech and actual farm implementation

## Host's Interests and Style

**Conversational and educational** — Jodi Boe and Sarah Lovas have a teacher-student dynamic, frequently asking clarifying questions for the audience. They're **deeply technical but accessible**, explaining complex concepts in practical terms. They care about **actionable insights over hype** — every discussion ties back to "how can you actually use this on your farm?"

**Style indicators:**
- Heavy use of specific technical examples and case studies
- Focus on practical applications and real-world scenarios
- Patient explanation of technical concepts
- Strong emphasis on data accuracy and reliability

## Audience Profile

**Precision agriculture practitioners and consultants** — Not farmers directly, but the agronomists, consultants, and tech specialists who serve them. Audience has technical sophistication but wants practical application. They're dealing with **real client problems** and need solutions that work in the field, not just in theory.

**Expertise level:** Intermediate to advanced technical knowledge, but hungry for practical implementation strategies.

## Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment on AI/data intersection with traditional agriculture.** Andreas's experience with:
- **Agricultural marketing and commodity boards** (6 Seeds) aligns with their precision ag consulting focus
- **AI-powered synthetic research** (Ditto) directly relates to their data analysis obsession
- **"AI for traditional industries"** expertise matches their core theme of tech adoption in agriculture
- **Teaching complex concepts** (Ivey Business School) matches their educational approach

## Best Hook

**"The Intelligence Economy in Agriculture"** — Position Andreas as the person who can explain how precision agriculture data becomes actionable intelligence, not just pretty maps. His combination of agricultural marketing expertise + AI application + traditional industry experience directly addresses their core challenge: helping precision ag practitioners turn data into decisions that farmers will actually act on.

**Specific angle:** How AI can bridge the gap between the precision data they're collecting (imagery, soil maps, yield data) and the marketing/communication needed to get farmers to actually implement the recommendations.

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"0.5 Tiny Bytes - Value of NAIP Imagery In Ag Mapping"** 

**Why this works:** This episode perfectly demonstrates their obsession with data quality, practical application, and making complex imagery data actionable. Andreas can position his AI work as the next logical step — taking all this high-quality imagery and spatial data they're collecting and using AI to extract insights that actually change farmer behavior.

**Pitch connection:** "I heard your episode on NAIP imagery value, and it got me thinking — you and Sarah do an incredible job helping consultants collect and analyze high-quality agricultural data. But there's still this massive gap between having great data and getting farmers to actually act on it. That's exactly the problem I've been solving with AI in agricultural marketing..."
