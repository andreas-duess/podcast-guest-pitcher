# Pitch: Digital Transformation & AI for Humans

## Subject Line Options
1. When the playbooks don't work anymore
2. Getting farmers to trust algorithms
3. AI in boardrooms full of skeptics


## Pitch Email
Hi Emi,

Your episode on leadership without certainty made me think of the time I walked into a room of Canadian wheat farmers and had to convince them to trust an algorithm over 40 years of gut instinct.

I built and sold Canada's largest food marketing agency by bridging that exact gap. Now I teach AI strategy at Ivey while running my own AI research company.

Here's what I learned: the technical part of AI adoption is easy. The human part — getting traditional leaders to change how they make decisions — that's where most implementations fail.

Your audience deals with this every day. I've got stories about what actually works when you're trying to move conservative organizations toward data-driven decisions. Including the spectacular failures that taught me more than the successes.

Want to dig into this on your show?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## Recurring Themes Across Episodes

1. **Leadership Through Technological Uncertainty** — How leaders navigate when traditional playbooks don't work
2. **Human-Centered AI Implementation** — Technology adoption that prioritizes people and organizational culture
3. **Systemic Risk & Governance** — Managing complexity and unintended consequences in digital transformation
4. **Practical AI for Business Growth** — Real-world applications that drive measurable results
5. **Vision & Strategic Thinking** — Long-term perspective in rapidly changing technological landscapes

## Host's Interests and Style

**Emi cares about:** The human side of technology adoption. She's drawn to leaders who understand that successful digital transformation requires emotional intelligence, team building, and cultural change — not just technical implementation.

**Interview style:** Conversational but substantive. She wants both strategic insights and practical wisdom. The episode titles suggest she values guests who can bridge high-level vision with actionable guidance.

**Preference:** Practitioners over pure theorists. Her guests are operators (CEO, CIO, former executives) who've actually implemented change, not just studied it.

## Audience Profile

**Who they are:** Mid-to-senior level executives and leaders in traditional industries who need to navigate digital transformation

**Expertise level:** Intermediate to advanced business professionals who understand the basics but need strategic guidance on implementation

**Pain points:** Balancing innovation with risk management, leading teams through uncertainty, making AI practical rather than theoretical

## Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment:**
- Andreas teaches AI strategy (matches host's focus on practical AI)
- Built and scaled a business in traditional industry (food/agriculture)
- Bridges technology and human/organizational challenges
- Has "scars and success" — real implementation experience
- Focuses on helping traditional industries adopt AI without fear

**Perfect fit:** Andreas is exactly what Emi's audience needs — someone who's been in their shoes (traditional industry) and successfully navigated the transition.

## Best Hook

**"The AI Adoption Paradox in Traditional Industries"** — How leaders in conservative sectors (food, agriculture, manufacturing) can overcome organizational resistance and cultural barriers to implement AI successfully, based on Andreas's experience convincing commodity boards to trust data over decades of gut instinct.

This directly addresses the host's core theme: the human challenge of technological change.

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**S1|Ep92: "AI, Governance, and Systemic Risk - Leadership and Value Creation When Certainty Is Gone"**

**Why this episode:** Andreas's story perfectly complements this theme. While that guest discussed governance frameworks, Andreas can share the ground-level experience of actually implementing AI in risk-averse traditional organizations — the practical "how" to complement the strategic "what."

**Pitch angle:** "Your recent episode on leadership when certainty is gone really resonated with me. Andreas has lived this challenge — he's the guy who had to convince Canadian commodity boards to embrace AI and data-driven decisions. He has both the battle scars and the blueprint for how traditional industry leaders can actually make this transition work."
