# Pitch: Future Food-Tech - Rethink Agri-Food Podcast Series

## Subject Line Options
1. Getting conservative ag orgs to adopt AI
2. What worked with Canadian commodity boards
3. Traditional farming meets algorithmic decisions


## Pitch Email
Hi there,

Your Digital Solutions episode touched on something I've been solving for years: how do you get traditional agricultural organizations to actually use AI instead of just talking about it?

I spent 30 years moving legacy ag toward technology. Built and sold Canada's largest independent food marketing agency, now run an AI research company while teaching strategy at Ivey Business School.

The breakthrough came when I stopped selling technology and started solving their immediate problems. Canadian wheat and canola boards didn't care about AI capabilities — they cared about making better market decisions faster than their competitors.

Turns out the psychology of convincing skeptical farmers works across cultures, but the implementation has to adapt to local market structures. What worked in Canada's centralized commodity system needs different approaches in Asia's fragmented markets.

I can share the specific frameworks that turned AI skeptics into champions, plus what failed and why.

Worth exploring for your show?

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Technology adoption in traditional agriculture** — Digital solutions, precision farming, tech integration
2. **Innovation leadership and R&D strategy** — How corporations drive innovation, create "safe spaces for blue sky thinking"
3. **Asian market dynamics** — Regional challenges, urbanization impact, consumer behavior shifts
4. **Practical implementation over theory** — Real-world applications, not academic concepts
5. **Systems-level thinking** — Supply chain optimization, resource efficiency, environmental impact

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Corporate-focused, solution-oriented approach.** The host gravitates toward:
- **Senior executives and innovation leaders** (not startups or academics)
- **Proven implementers** who've actually deployed solutions at scale
- **Regional expertise** with global applicability
- **Interview-driven format** that extracts practical insights
- **Business impact stories** over theoretical frameworks

The tone is professional conference-style — they want actionable intelligence for industry decision-makers.

## 3. Audience Profile

**Senior agri-food executives and innovation managers** who:
- Attend high-end industry summits (World Agri-Tech, Future Food-Tech)
- Make technology adoption decisions for traditional food/ag companies
- Need to justify innovation investments to boards
- Operate globally but often focus on Asia-Pacific growth
- Want proven case studies, not experimental concepts

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment in 3 areas:**
- **Traditional industry transformation** — Andreas has 30 years moving legacy industries toward tech adoption
- **Practical AI implementation** — He's actually using AI in agriculture (6 Seeds), not just talking about it
- **Executive credibility** — Built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency, teaches at business school

His "AI for traditional industries" expertise directly addresses this audience's core challenge.

## 5. Best Hook

**"How a former Google executive convinced Canadian commodity boards to embrace AI — and what Asian agri-food companies can learn from their success."**

This hooks because:
- Addresses the "Digital Solutions for Farming" theme directly
- Shows proven results with traditional, skeptical organizations
- Offers regional insights (Canada to Asia knowledge transfer)
- Positions Andreas as the bridge between tech and traditional agriculture

## 6. Episode Reference Point

**"Digital Solutions for Farming in Asia"** — This episode should be the primary reference because:
- It directly mirrors Andreas's current work (6 Seeds agricultural marketing + AI)
- Shows the host cares about practical digital implementation
- The Asia focus allows Andreas to offer comparative insights from North American agriculture
- Perfect setup for discussing how traditional farming organizations actually adopt and benefit from AI tools

**Pitch angle:** "Your Digital Solutions episode touched on the challenges of tech adoption in traditional farming. I'd love to share how we got some of the most conservative agricultural organizations in North America to not just accept AI, but actively champion it — and what that teaches us about scaling digital solutions across Asia's fragmented agri-food system."
