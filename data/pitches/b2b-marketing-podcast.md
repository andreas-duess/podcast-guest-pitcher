# Pitch: B2B Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. The B2B say-do gap in traditional industries
2. Trust-building with 100-year-old wheat boards
3. Making AI comfortable for commodity buyers


## Pitch Email
Hi Joel,

Vanessa's "big brand energy" episode was smart - that island experience made fintech buyers comfortable with radical experimentation.

I create AI comfort zones for industries that make fintech look cutting-edge. Commodity boards, agricultural co-ops, food manufacturers. 

After 30 years from Ogilvy London to Google, I built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency. The "say-do gap" between what B2B buyers claim they want versus what actually drives their decisions is huge.

Your audience would connect with how I convinced 100-year-old wheat boards to embrace AI faster than most tech companies. It's about trust-building in conservative B2B environments.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Trust & Influence in B2B** — Core theme of building credibility and driving decision-making in complex B2B environments
2. **Commercial Marketing Philosophy** — Focus on marketers who drive revenue, not just leads; "commercial marketers" who understand business impact
3. **Physical vs Digital Balance** — Navigating the post-COVID world where digital is hygiene but physical experiences create differentiation
4. **Traditional Industries Embracing Innovation** — How established sectors (fintech, payments) break from "baseline playbooks" to stand out
5. **Authentic Brand Differentiation** — Creating memorable experiences that go beyond rational decision-making to build emotional connections

## Host's Interests & Style

**Joel Harrison** is interview-driven but conversational, with clear intellectual curiosity about **why** marketers make unconventional choices. He's drawn to:
- Marketers who challenge "proven models" and "baseline playbooks"
- The intersection of rational/emotional in B2B decision-making
- Practical philosophy — how strategic thinking translates to real business outcomes
- Post-pandemic evolution of B2B engagement
- He appreciates provocative takes but wants substance behind the provocation

**Style Note**: He admits when something surprises him (re-read the island press release multiple times) — he values genuine innovation over marketing theater.

## Audience Profile

Senior B2B marketers and CMOs dealing with:
- Complex, relationship-driven sales cycles
- Highly regulated or traditional industries
- The challenge of standing out in commoditized markets
- Post-COVID recalibration of engagement strategies
- Pressure to prove marketing's commercial impact

**Expertise Level**: Sophisticated — they understand ABM, enterprise sales, compliance challenges, and the nuances of trust-building in B2B.

## Overlap with Guest

**Direct Alignment**:
- **Traditional Industries + Innovation**: Andreas took agriculture (more traditional than fintech) and applied cutting-edge AI
- **Commercial Marketing**: Built and sold a business — ultimate commercial outcome
- **Say-Do Gap**: Mirrors the rational/emotional decision-making theme Joel explores
- **Challenging Baseline Playbooks**: Most AI speakers target tech audiences; Andreas targets traditional industries
- **Trust in Complex B2B**: Convincing commodity boards requires the same trust-building Joel discusses

## Best Hook

**"The AI Island Moment for Traditional Industries"**

Position Andreas as someone who created the equivalent of Enfuse's island experience — but for entire traditional industries afraid of AI. Just like Vanessa had to make people "feel" fintech differently, Andreas makes agricultural commodity boards "feel" AI differently.

The hook: **How do you make a 100-year-old wheat board more comfortable with AI than most tech companies are?**

This directly parallels Joel's fascination with how Vanessa made highly regulated fintech buyers comfortable with radical experimentation.

## Episode to Reference

**Episode 205 (Vanessa Schotes/Enfuse)** — The island episode.

**Specific reference point**: "I heard your conversation with Vanessa about creating 'big brand energy' in traditional B2B environments. Andreas has done something similar — but instead of an island, he's created AI comfort zones for industries that make fintech look cutting-edge. Commodity boards, agricultural co-ops, food manufacturers. His 'say-do gap' work is essentially the B2B equivalent of Enfuse's subliminal sensory marketing — but using data instead of nitrogen-frozen ice cream."

This positions Andreas as a peer to Joel's most memorable recent guest, operating in an even more traditional space with equally innovative approaches.
