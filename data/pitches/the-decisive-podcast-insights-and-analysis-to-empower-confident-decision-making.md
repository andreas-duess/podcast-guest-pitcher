# Pitch: The Decisive Podcast: Insights and analysis to empower confident decision-making.

## Subject Line Options
1. Predictive decisions in agricultural chaos
2. From gut instinct to data intelligence
3. Conservative ag orgs adopting AI faster than expected


## Pitch Email
Kristen,

Your agentic AI episode caught my attention, especially the shift from reactive triage to predictive decisions. I see similar transformations in agricultural supply chains, where weather, geopolitics, and policy create even more volatility than traditional manufacturing.

30 years implementing technology in traditional industries, built and sold Canada's largest independent food agency, now work with agricultural commodity boards navigating AI adoption. Also teach AI strategy at Ivey.

I can share specific case studies of conservative agricultural organizations moving from gut-instinct to data-driven supply chain intelligence. Including resistance patterns and measurable ROI from early adopters.

The intelligence economy is reshaping agriculture. Organizations adapting fastest are gaining serious competitive advantages.

Andreas
