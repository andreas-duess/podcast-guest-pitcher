# Pitch: Better Seed, Better Life Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Bridging the consumer research say-do gap
2. AI insights for seed company marketing
3. From lab innovation to consumer behavior


## Pitch Email
Hi there,

Bethany's points about the consumer research "say-do gap" in Episode 23 were spot-on. At Nourish Food Marketing, we spent 16 years watching this exact problem: what agricultural consumers say versus what they actually do are completely different.

Seed companies face this daily - explaining complex breeding innovations to consumers who make emotional decisions, not fact-based ones.

Now I teach AI strategy at Ivey and run synthetic research projects that help traditional ag organizations bridge this gap without expensive focus groups that lie anyway. We can predict actual consumer behavior in agriculture.

Your audience deals with this constantly. Want to explore what we've learned about decoding real consumer decision-making?

Andreas
