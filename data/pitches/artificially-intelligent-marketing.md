# Pitch: Artificially Intelligent Marketing

## Subject Line Options
1. AI implementation beyond the hype?
2. Real AI disruption patterns for marketers
3. What marketers should prep for with AI

## Pitch Email
Paul and Martin,

Your recent predictions for 2026 got me thinking about the gap between what AI companies promise and what's actually working in traditional industries right now.

I'm Andreas Duess. I teach AI strategy at Ivey Business School and run two AI companies, including one doing synthetic research. My contrarian take comes from 16 years building and selling Canada's largest independent food marketing agency. 

While tech companies fight model wars, I'm watching commodity boards and food manufacturers quietly build sustainable AI advantages with decades of proprietary data.

The "say-do gap" I've researched shows consumers lie in surveys 40% of the time, but AI can finally reveal what they actually buy. Traditional industries are using this to outmaneuver venture-backed startups by solving real problems instead of chasing benchmarks.

I could share concrete examples of how unglamorous sectors are making money with AI right now. And what that means for your audience's competitive positioning.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas

## Analysis Brief
# Pitch Analysis: Andreas Duess → Artificially Intelligent Marketing

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Practical AI Implementation** — Moving beyond hype to real-world applications and what marketers should "actually prepare for"
2. **Industry Disruption Patterns** — How AI is reshaping established marketing practices and business models
3. **Strategic Positioning** — Where companies should place their bets in the evolving AI landscape
4. **Performance vs. Promise** — Cutting through AI marketing claims to focus on measurable results
5. **Future-Proofing Marketing** — Preparing for shifts in consumer behavior and technology adoption

## 2. Host Style & Interests

**Paul Avery & Martin Broadhurst** are **analytical practitioners** who:
- Value **concrete predictions over abstract concepts** ("What Marketers Should Actually Prepare For")
- Prefer **industry insider perspective** (they analyze model releases, acquisitions, tactical shifts)
- Like **contrarian takes** that challenge conventional wisdom
- Focus on **actionable intelligence** rather than theoretical discussions
- Appreciate guests who can **bridge the gap** between AI capabilities and marketing reality

## 3. Audience Profile

**Mid-to-senior level marketing professionals** who:
- Are actively implementing AI tools (not just curious about them)
- Need practical guidance on competitive positioning
- Want to understand industry implications before they hit mainstream
- Are sophisticated enough to evaluate model performance and strategic moves
- Seek tactical advantages in the "intelligence economy"

## 4. Overlap with Guest

**Direct alignment in 4 key areas:**
- **Traditional Industry AI Adoption** — Andreas's food/agriculture experience matches their focus on real-world implementation
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** — His "Say-Do Gap" expertise aligns with their performance-focused approach
- **Business Model Evolution** — His agency-building experience fits their interest in industry disruption
- **Academic + Practitioner Credibility** — Teaching at Ivey while running AI companies gives him the insider-outsider perspective they value

## 5. Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industry AI Advantage"** — While tech companies fight model wars, traditional industries like food and agriculture are quietly building sustainable competitive moats with AI because they have something tech companies don't: decades of proprietary data and established customer relationships. Andreas can show how commodity boards are outmaneuvering venture-backed startups by applying AI to real business problems instead of chasing benchmarks.

This angle works because:
- Contrarian take on the current AI narrative
- Concrete examples from unglamorous but profitable sectors
- Practical implementation focus over theoretical potential
- Addresses their audience's need for competitive differentiation

## 6. Reference Episode

**"AI Predictions for 2026"** — Andreas should reference this episode because:
- It shows he understands their forward-looking, practical approach
- He can build on their predictions with ground-truth examples from traditional industries
- He can offer a counterpoint to their tech-focused predictions with insights from sectors that move slower but deploy more deliberately
- It positions him as someone who can validate (or challenge) their predictions with real-world data

**Pitch angle**: "I heard your 2026 predictions episode and have some contrarian data from the traditional industries that are actually making money with AI right now..."
