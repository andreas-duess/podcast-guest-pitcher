# Pitch: Pipe Dream | A B2B Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Pipeline, not therapy sessions
2. AI that actually builds revenue
3. Say-do gap killing your conversion


## Pitch Email
Hey Jason,

Your "expensive therapy sessions" line about podcasts with downloads but no pipeline was brutal and accurate.

16 years building Canada's largest food agency by getting traditional industries to trust data over gut. Sold it, now using AI to solve the "say-do gap" — massive disconnect between what prospects tell you versus what they actually buy.

Most AI marketing advice comes from people who've never built pipeline with it. I've turned agricultural commodity boards into predictable revenue machines using this stuff.

Your audience sounds frustrated with demand gen that doesn't convert. I can show them how AI lets you see what prospects actually do with content and turn that into pipeline.

Andreas


## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## Recurring Themes (4 Key Themes)

1. **Pipeline Over Vanity Metrics** — The host is obsessed with marketing activities that directly drive revenue, not just awareness or engagement
2. **Owned Media as Revenue Driver** — Building podcasts, newsletters, and content systems that sales teams actually use to close deals
3. **Practical Implementation Over Theory** — Focus on tactical decisions, conversion systems, and "how" rather than high-level concepts
4. **Anti-Hype/Pro-Reality** — Explicitly calling out tactics that "look good on paper but don't move the business forward"

## Host's Interests and Style

**Jason Bradwell** is blunt, results-focused, and skeptical of marketing theater. He cares about:
- **Revenue attribution** — "downloads don't pay salaries, pipeline does"
- **Sales/marketing alignment** — content that sales teams actually use
- **Long-term compound growth** over "flash in the pan" tactics
- **Practical problem-solving** — getting around legal blocks, converting downloads to meetings

**Style**: Direct, no-BS interview approach. Values provocative but substantiated takes backed by real business experience.

## Audience Profile

B2B marketers and founders who are:
- **Frustrated with traditional demand gen** that doesn't convert
- **Already investing in content** but not seeing pipeline results
- **Mid-market companies** (not enterprise or startup-focused)
- **Operationally sophisticated** — they understand conversion systems and attribution

## Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment on 3 fronts**:
1. **Traditional industry expertise** — Andreas brings credibility with "old school" B2B companies the audience struggles to reach
2. **Built/scaled/sold a business** — Real practitioner experience, not just consultant theory
3. **AI for practical business results** — Not hype, but actual revenue-driving applications

## Best Hook

**"The marketer who used AI to turn agricultural commodity boards into pipeline machines"**

This hits Jason's sweet spots:
- **Traditional industries** (harder to crack than tech)
- **AI as a revenue tool** (not just efficiency play)
- **Practitioner credibility** (built and sold the agency)
- **Contrarian angle** (most AI marketing talk is theoretical)

Position Andreas as the guy who can show B2B marketers how to use AI for actual pipeline generation in industries that are notoriously hard to digitize.

## Episode Reference for Pitch

**"Why Your Podcast Has Downloads But No Pipeline"**

This episode perfectly sets up Andreas's "say-do gap" expertise. Reference Jason's point about podcasts becoming "expensive therapy sessions" and position Andreas as someone who can show how AI helps marketers see what prospects actually do (not just what they say in surveys) — turning content consumption into predictable pipeline.

## Pitch Angle

*"Most AI marketing advice comes from people who've never actually built pipeline with it. Andreas spent 16 years building Canada's largest independent food agency by getting traditional industries to trust data over gut instinct — and now he's using AI to close the gap between what prospects say and what they actually buy."*
