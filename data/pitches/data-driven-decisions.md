# Pitch: Data-Driven Decisions

## Subject Line Options
1. Culture change through data insights?
2. From gut decisions to data-driven culture
3. Real data implementation strategies

## Pitch Email
Hi Zontee,

Your recent episode on building experimentation culture really hit me. The part about transforming organizations that aren't naturally data-driven? I've been doing exactly that with Canadian commodity boards and food manufacturers.

Picture this: agriculture executives who've made million-dollar crop decisions based on "feel" for 30 years. Getting them to trust data over gut instinct.

I built and sold Canada's largest independent food marketing agency. Now I run an AI research company and teach data strategy at Ivey Business School. The techniques for cultural transformation in farming, manufacturing, and food production work for any organization struggling with data adoption.

I've got a specific playbook for turning farming executives into data believers. There's something I call the "say-do gap" that trips up most traditional marketers.

Happy to share the details if this sounds interesting.

Andreas

## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Booking Strategy Brief

## Recurring Themes (Key Focus Areas)

1. **Culture Change Through Data** — Moving organizations from gut-instinct to data-driven decision making
2. **Practical Data Implementation** — How to actually use data tools and insights, not just collect them
3. **Cross-Departmental Data Leadership** — Marketing leading other departments with data insights
4. **First-Party Data Challenges** — Accessing, interpreting, and acting on your own data vs. external sources
5. **Balancing Data with Human Judgment** — Finding the sweet spot between analytics and intuition

## Host's Interests and Style

**Zontee Hou cares about:** Organizational transformation through data, practical implementation over theory, and marketing as a leadership function that influences entire companies.

**Interview style:** Conversational but structured around actionable insights. Focuses on "how-to" rather than "what-if." Values guests who can speak to both strategic vision and tactical execution.

**Preferred content:** Real transformation stories, specific methodologies, and guests who've actually changed organizational culture (not just talked about it).

## Audience Profile

**Primary audience:** Marketing directors and VPs at mid-to-large companies struggling to implement data-driven practices. They have access to data but need frameworks for turning it into organizational change.

**Expertise level:** Intermediate to advanced marketers who understand data concepts but need leadership strategies and change management tactics.

**Pain points:** Getting buy-in from other departments, proving ROI of data initiatives, and building sustainable data cultures beyond just collecting metrics.

## Overlap with Guest

**Perfect alignment areas:**
- **Cultural transformation expertise** — Andreas actually changed traditional industries (agriculture/food) from intuition-based to data-driven
- **Cross-industry data leadership** — He's influenced commodity boards, manufacturers, and traditional businesses
- **Practical AI implementation** — Teaching at Ivey + running Ditto gives him both academic and real-world credibility
- **The "say-do gap"** concept directly addresses the first-party data challenges Zontee's audience faces

## Best Hook

**"The Traditional Industries Transformation Angle"**

Position Andreas as the guest who cracked the code on data transformation in the most change-resistant industries on earth. While most data experts work with tech companies already bought into analytics, Andreas convinced Canadian commodity boards and food manufacturers to abandon decades of gut-instinct decision making.

**Specific pitch angle:** "How to turn agriculture executives into data believers" — if he can data-transform farming, he can help any traditional industry.

## Episode to Reference in Pitch

**"How Marketers Can Build a Culture of Data and Experimentation"** (2024-07-16)

**Why this episode:** The description specifically mentions a "non-marketing but data-driven leader" who became CMO and built experimentation culture. Andreas has the exact same profile — he came from traditional industries, became a marketing leader, and built data culture in resistant organizations.

**Pitch connection:** "Like Shafqat brought data thinking to Optimizely, Andreas brought it to Canadian agriculture — arguably a much harder transformation challenge."

## Recommended Pitch Focus

Lead with the commodity board transformation story, reference the Optimizely episode, and position the conversation around "data-driven decisions in data-resistant industries." This directly serves Zontee's audience while offering a fresh angle she hasn't covered.
