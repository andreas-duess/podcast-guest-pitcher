# Pitch: No Bull, Just Beef - The Small Business Marketing Podcast

## Subject Line Options
1. Anti-hype CEO here - let's talk real marketing
2. Your AI skeptic guest who actually uses it
3. No Bull guest pitch from a fellow BS-caller

## Pitch Email
Hi Jo and Todd,

Your "Beige Is a Choice" episode hit exactly what I'm seeing with small businesses and AI. Everyone's terrified of either falling behind or losing their authenticity.

I'm Andreas Duess. Spent 16 years building and selling Canada's largest independent food marketing agency. Now I work in agricultural marketing and AI strategy. 

What makes my perspective different? I've had to convince commodity boards that data beats gut instinct. Most AI experts haven't actually run a business or dealt with clients who think "digital" is a dirty word.

I have the battle scars and the systems that actually work.

I could share the frameworks I use to help traditional businesses figure out when AI makes you more efficient versus when it makes you generic. Plus the real story of scaling an agency in a commoditized industry.

Let me know if you want to chat.

Andreas

## Analysis Brief
# Podcast Analysis & Guest Pitch Strategy

## 1. Recurring Themes (5 Key Areas)

1. **Anti-Hype, Pro-Reality** — They consistently call out BS in marketing and business, preferring honest, practical approaches over trendy buzzwords
2. **AI Skepticism with Practical Application** — Not anti-AI, but deeply wary of lazy shortcuts and "beige" automation that strips authenticity
3. **Small Business Systems & Operations** — Focus on getting organized, implementing proper processes, and moving from chaos to control
4. **Authentic Brand Differentiation** — Standing out in crowded markets through genuine positioning rather than generic marketing
5. **No-Fluff Practicality** — Every episode promises actionable insights without the typical marketing podcast padding

## 2. Host's Interests and Style

**Jo and Todd are conversational realists** who:
- Prefer provocative, honest takes over safe advice
- Value authenticity and are suspicious of anything that feels manufactured
- Care deeply about helping small businesses avoid common pitfalls
- Use humor and direct language ("shit show," "no bull, just beef")
- Want guests who have actually done the work, not just theorized about it
- Are particularly interested in the tension between efficiency and authenticity

## 3. Audience Profile

**Small business owners and marketers** who are:
- Running lean operations, often chaotic or under-systemized
- Skeptical of marketing hype but hungry for what actually works
- Dealing with AI pressure but unsure how to use it authentically
- Looking for practical, implementable advice from people who've been there
- Value straight talk over polished corporate speak

## 4. Overlap with Guest

Andreas maps perfectly to their core interests:
- **Anti-hype AI stance** — He teaches practical AI application, not pie-in-the-sky promises
- **Built and scaled a real business** — 16 years from startup to successful exit
- **Traditional industry expertise** — Knows how to convince skeptical, old-school businesses
- **Systems and organization** — Had to systematize an agency to make it sellable
- **Authentic differentiation** — Built Canada's largest independent food agency in a commoditized market

## 5. Best Hook

**"The AI Reality Check for Small Business"** — Andreas can speak to exactly what Jo and Todd explored in EP 21: How to use AI without becoming beige. His angle: He's the guy who actually convinced traditional commodity boards (the most skeptical audiences on earth) to embrace data and AI. He has battle-tested frameworks for when AI helps vs. when it hurts authenticity.

**Specific pitch angle**: "Most AI experts haven't actually run a business or convinced skeptical clients. Andreas spent 16 years building an agency in agriculture — one of the most traditional industries — and had to prove that data beats gut instinct. He knows exactly when AI makes you more efficient vs. when it makes you generic."

## 6. Episode to Reference in Pitch

**EP 21: "Beige Is a Choice – How to Stand Out in the Age of AI"**

This is the perfect reference point because:
- It directly addresses the AI authenticity tension Andreas specializes in
- Shows the hosts are already thinking about these issues
- Andreas can build on their concerns with real-world examples from traditional industries
- He can offer the "how to actually do this" that follows their "here's what's wrong" discussion

**Pitch reference**: "I heard your episode 'Beige Is a Choice' and you nailed the AI authenticity problem. Andreas has spent years solving exactly this — how do you use AI to compete without losing what makes you different? He's got the scars and the systems to prove it works."
