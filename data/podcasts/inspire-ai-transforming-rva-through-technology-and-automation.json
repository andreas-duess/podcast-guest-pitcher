      "description": "<p>Send a text</p><p>When intelligence is everywhere but correctness is scarce, how do we lead without cutting corners? We sit down with Tianzhen (Tangent) Lin\u2014veteran engineer and systems thinker\u2014to unpack a practical, durable approach to building AI\u2011assisted products that hold up under pressure. No hype, no shortcuts: just the patterns that make teams faster and safer at the same time.<br/><br/>We start by reframing large language models as \u201ceager interns\u201d: fast, helpful, and prone to saying y"

We dive into LLM-as-judge\u2014the simple but powerful pattern where one model generates and another evaluates\u2014to show how leaders can scale quality without surrendering standards. From summaries that must capture the one sentence that matters to support answers that need to be grounded, safe, and on-brand, we break down where this approach shines and where it can fail you.<br/><br/"

That shift changes how we make calls, how we manage risk, and how we design trust into everyday workflows.<br/><br/>We unpack practical decision hygiene that keeps speed from steamrolling s"
