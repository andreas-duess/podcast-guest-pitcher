      "description": "<p>Sarah and Jodi discuss NAIP aerial imagery and why this high-resolution imagery is invaluable for precision agriculture work in the United States. They share workflows for validating zones, aligning layers, and spotting year-over-year patterns while noting timing pitfalls, thanks to NAIP imagery as a background source.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss...</p><p>\u2022 what NAIP is and who collects it<br/>\u2022 benefits of high resolution often associated with newer NAIP imagery<br/>\u2022 four-band imagery"

      "description": "<p>We talk with Matt Krueger about his field-level view of autonomous tillage with a 9R series John Deere tractor, from kit installation to dust-driven safety stops, and how better boundaries and AutoPath boost both uptime and data quality. Matt's story centers on labor flexibility, real costs, and where autonomy should expand next.</p><p>In this special hour-long episode we talk:<br/>\u2022 autonomy kit details, JDLink Boost connectivity, dual receivers<br/>\u2022 autonomy-grade boundaries and safe offse"

Then we lay out a practical plan to find acidic patches with smarter sampling, NDVI, and grid-the-zone strategies, and point to lime and buffer pH for the fix.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss...<br/>\u2022 soil pH as chemical control and pH level of 7 is neutral<br/>\u2022 aluminum toxicity risk to crops increases below 6.5 pH\u00a0<br/>\u2022 wheat relatively tolerant, legumes struggle wit"
