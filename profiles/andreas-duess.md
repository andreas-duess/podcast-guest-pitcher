# Andreas Duess — Podcast Guest Profile

## The Story in 30 Seconds

Andreas spent 30 years at the intersection of technology and traditional industries. He went from Ogilvy London to Google B2B marketing, then co-founded Nourish Food Marketing and built it into Canada's largest independent food agency before a successful exit. Now he runs 6 Seeds (agricultural marketing) and Ditto (AI-powered synthetic research), teaches AI strategy at Ivey Business School, and speaks globally about how traditional industries can stop being afraid of AI and start using it to compete.

## What Makes Him Different

Most AI speakers are technologists talking to other technologists. Andreas is a practitioner who actually built, scaled, and sold a business in one of the most traditional industries on earth. He knows what it's like to convince a commodity board that data beats gut instinct — and he has the scars and the success to prove it.
